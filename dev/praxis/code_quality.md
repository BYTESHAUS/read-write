# Code quality

Code quality is the cement of software. It's imperceptible for users, but must be of superior grade for high, heavy-duty and complex constructions.

## High quality code

That's _clean code_, which beyond following acknowledged guidelienes and principles (like SOLID)

+ **reads** in both directions: a developer will learn the domain from it while domain export with some assistance will understand the written business logic
+ **teaches** techniques, gimmick and new features
+ **inspires** to work with

## Test coverage

Natural question is does clean code need tests ? Besides Test-Driven-Development, yes too.

### Pitfalls

#### Disproportionate coverage



#### False green tests

Bad test is worse than no test and the worst test is one that where the error is. The simplest parallel, what's warse an alarm on broken car anti-skid, 

#### Formalism


## Reasons of bad code

+ First and obvious: time/budget pressure
+ Lack of feedback (no code review, no pair programming) and learning
+ Perfectionism and goind hand in hand procrastination 
+ Demotivation
