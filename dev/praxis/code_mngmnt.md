# Code- and coding management

The exponential (somewhere chaotic) growth of software projects in 2000s has founded a "parallel universe" of their organization: requirements/issue tracking, code collecting/versioning, collaboration, DevOps, deployment services, project management. Systems, frameworks, methodologies.

Admitting the customers/users point of view (not _how_ but _what_ matters) draws a distinct watershed: organization serves development vs. vice versa.

## Attributes of good organisation
Above all, each process shall have an exact explanation how does it facilitate development, spare resource, automate routines. 

+ Intuitive environment and short learning curves
+ Processes do not suppress direct and casual communication (also with customers and users)
+ Meetings are condensed and limited to involved participants
+ Meetings must have tangible outcomes
+ Creating a branch or staging system has a definite purpose
+ Iteration cycles have feasible and ponderable results but relatively small organizational overhead
+ Developers seek communication with leads and managers
+ Prevent commits of bad code (copy-pasted, guidelines violation, anti-patterns, obsolete features)
