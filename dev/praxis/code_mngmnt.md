# Code- and coding management

The exponential (somewhere chaotic) growth of software projects in 2000s has founded a "parallel universe" of their organization: requirements/issue tracking, code collecting/versioning, collaboration, DevOps, deployment services, project management. Systems, frameworks, methodologies.

Supposing the customers/users perspective "not _how_ but _what_ matters" draws a distinct watershed: organization serves development, **or** _vice versa_.

## Good organisation

Ideally process or measure shall have an exact explanation how does it facilitate development, spare resources, automate routines. (Not because it's a trend or in chosen methodology.)

### Technical pluses

+ Intuitive environment with short learning curves and minor maintenance
+ Limited branching and staging for justified "autonomy" (e.g. branch for optional/risky features bundle, test system for dedicated team)
+ Barriers for commits of bad code (copy-pasted, guidelines violation, anti-patterns, obsolete features)
+ Eager use of code automation tools (including own frameworks)

#### Advanced
+ Automated creation and workflow of issues (e.g. create tickets from `// ToDo:` comments or `NotImplementedException` and submit when coded)

### Behavioral advantages

+ _Processes_ do not suppress direct and casual communication (also with customers and users)
+ Meetings are condensed and limited to involved participants and provide tangible outcomes on code
+ Iteration cycles plan feasible and ponderable results with relatively small organizational overhead
+ Coaching and mentoring for new stuff
