## Architecture vs. design
I'd reserve the term ___architecture___ for processors, operating systems, global computing services, spectrum of IT solutions, or Acropolis of Athens.\
Whereas ___design___ comprises much better the development of applications, even of enterprise scale. Note the key word - application (use of something available for particular tasks).

## Patterns

## Application model
Model is a groundstone of most applications
