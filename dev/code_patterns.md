# Code patterns

IT vision of  *patterns* has spread over software templates, project solutions, methodologies and even developer's manners, but here let's stay on its initial meaning.

As growth of instruction sets of processors resulted in abstractions clever programmers noticed useful patterns of code to repeat and recommend. 
In 1970-1990s they got augmented, systematized and popularized, hence much admitted of them become dogmatic and featured in languages/frameworks.

## Pitfalls

### "Patterns-in-themselves"

Fitting the code to an applealing pattern is like inventing a sentence just for a catchy word. This also concerns overuse, for example, when a trivial Create()/New() is done through Builder/Factory.

### Pattern as anti-pattern

Unsuitable context may negate any pattern. Example? Singleton in Java or C# where injection is a better solution: `void ProvePeriphery(ILog sharedLog);`

### Naming

Own names for established patterns isn't a good practice.

## Wrapping up

An attentive developer will intuitively follow design patterns even unaware of them. However learning is essential to know recent and use proper names and signatures.
