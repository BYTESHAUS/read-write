# Nice to have in C#
C# isn't a universal formula and its team with community doesn't possess infinite resources. However this language is rather suited for some things that could boost its popularity.

## Basic exception, messages and guards

## Math
Native [Math](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math) is pretty scarce, and 3d-party libraries aren't in the state of the art.

C# would only profit with a lightweight assembly which could: 
+ itemize more [constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant)
+ provide more useful functions (there're myriads uncovered)
+ approximate popular irrational values like Ï€ (Pi) to requested length
+ generate and check numbers in [sequences](http://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome) (`bool Prime.Has(ulong num)`), detect sequences
+ introduce complex numbers
+ parallelize, async heavy algorithms with progress report and cancellation option
