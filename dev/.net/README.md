# Subjective about C#
C# on .NET deserves to be noted as one of the most expressive and powerful languages/platforms for business applications. It's a flagship of Microsoft&#174; (enough said), where the ship is .NET and the flag is C#.
 
It evolves nonstop, providing us with up-to-date, concise, comprehensible syntax. Its team learns from drawbacks and advantages of other languages and picks trade off between readability and brevity.
 
C# allows developers to focus on readable code while .NET will take care of compiling it into effective and safe executable. The cleaner the code the better performance.

Albeit C# has destructors, finalizers, garbage collecting, memory allocation, "front door" to unmanaged code  - programming them doesn't look natural (unless it's a very specific task, workaround of bizarre bugs or non-conforming 3d party).

Surprisingly C# is widely utilized in APIs and drivers to industry-standard embedded software (i.a. automotive and machinery).

This language has incredible parts like [LINQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321724/where-can-i-get-a-good-concise-linq-cheatsheet) or [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl) but isn't monumentally accomplished.\
