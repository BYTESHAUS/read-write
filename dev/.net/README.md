# Subjective about C#
C#\.NET deserves to be noted as one of the most expressive and powerful language/platforms for business applications. It's a flagship of Microsoft&#174; (enough said), where the ship is .NET and the flag is C#.
 
It evolves nonstop, providing us with up-to-date, concise, comprehensible syntax. Its team learns from drawbacks and advantages of other languages and picks trade off between readability and brevity.
 
The mission of C# -- you write clean code and .NET cares that it gets translated into effective and safe executable. Though in C# one finds destructors, finalizers, garbage collecting, memory allocation, "front door" to unmanaged code  - programming them doesn't look sound (unless it's a very specific task, workaround of bizarre bugs or non-conforming 3d party).
