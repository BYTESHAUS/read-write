# Subjective about C#
C# on .NET deserves to be noted as one of the most **eloquent** and **powerful** languages/platforms for business applications. It's a flagship of Microsoft (enough said), where the ship is .NET and the flag is C#.

It evolves nonstop, providing us with up-to-date, concise, comprehensible syntax (lambdas, i.a.) and incredible features ([LINQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321724/where-can-i-get-a-good-concise-linq-cheatsheet), [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl) i.a.). Its team learns from drawbacks and advantages of other languages, [proposals](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/proposals) and picks trade off between readability and brevity.
 
C# allows developers to focus on clean code while .NET will take care of compiling that into effective and safe executables. The cleaner the code the better performance.

Albeit C# has destructors, finalizers, calls to garbage collector, memory allocation, "front door" to unmanaged code  - programming them looks unnatural, unless it's a very specific task, workaround of bizarre bugs or non-conforming 3d party.

Surprisingly C# is widely utilized in APIs and drivers to industry-standard embedded software (i.a. automotive and machinery).

With all given praise C# isn't monumentally accomplished and if i dare to express some observations&nbsp;:arrow_lower_left:\
