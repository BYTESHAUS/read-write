# TDD on DDD

Simplicity and versatility makes **T**est **D**riven **D**esing superb for new development. 

It's simple while needs neither special special skills nor prescribed processes, while popular unit-test libraries are enough to start.\
It's versatile since maybe applied in any extent and direction, mock and stub anything or rely on real data.

The purpose of TDD is no way test automation but means to\
+ grope **concepts** and get hands-on feeling on subjects (be it bookkeeping routines or starship model)\
+ vitalize skeleton **functionality** and evaluate trends with risks\
+ couple design dreams with reality of programming possibilities

Optionally:
+ define **test framework** of the application

TDD and **D**omain **D**riven **D**esign are a perfect match and will boost each other.

## Tests as entry point to application

It's not enough to write greatly developed and effective tests, which nobody will explore unless they get red.
