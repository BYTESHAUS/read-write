# Use of frameworks and libraries

Full-fledged 3d-party frameworks (libraries, packages) are a **vital**, "energy-saving" theme, which allows developers to focus on application business, design and UX rather than tame technologies, write tons of boilerplate code, fix bugs, update sources.

All-around pro solutions aren't free but annual dev licenses for selected platform below $1K will quickly pay off even in a small commercial project. Let alone live support and membership in durable motivated community.&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\

## Frontend

There's a healthy choice between more than experienced commercial<sup>:dollar:</sup> and not providers of suites, frameworks, controls for Rapid Application Development: Telerik, Devexpress, Infragistics - to name a few.

You get the best out-of-the-box: state-of-the-art UI professional look&feel and don't re-invent the wheel (unless it's rounder than others).

## Backend

Inelaborate applications need no elaborated structure. They start from few classes of the data context.

For any big application either time for EVALIATION an a steep learning curve of the adopted framework must be planned or one own developed.

Quite many backend frameworks are good at themselves but will load your project with too much unclaimed "ballast" code (goodbye [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)).

## Initiative projects

Some projects launched on GitHub on initiative of individual or group have grown to industry standards and got adopted in mainstream languages. Remember [Newton.json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
 
When applying such 3d-party think if there's a community (maybe, only you) - able to support the project.
