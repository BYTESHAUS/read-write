# Application view

View, as an interface to human sensors and actions in response, could be even not a sight but a voice assistant, or use other means of communication. Thinking on how disabled people will use your application isn't only fair, but can help with design posers down to business logic.

## Acceptance

No error, null, process behind shall break presentation or freeze it without plausible feedback (e.g. perceptible start wuthout animated splash screen).

A view, which loads enough remote data, must decently run even on bad connection. Trivial? Alas, not for some mail services.
