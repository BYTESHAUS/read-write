**What makes software?** In a word - _development_, in four - \
[![For colors of software](../pencraft/readme+/_rsc/_img/illus/dev/fromBlackCodeToGoldenArc.jpg)](../pencraft/readme+/_rsc/)\
<sup>:de:</sup> <sub>The colors were inspired by the informal idea of the German flag (_Schwarz-Rot-Gold_): from the dark past through the bloody present to the golden future. Some tear-blue was inserted to show the lachrymose development of the story.</sub>

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** make up a blend of overlapping and time-unordered processes.&nbsp;<sup>:stop_button:</sup>

DevOps, administration, testing, deployment, documentation, project management - these are the tints and shades. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:stop_button:</sup> <sub>Some words more? With all respect to DevOps, testing, management, and administration they only facilitate the development and deployment of software.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:anchor:</sup> <sub>Digging in code </sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:balloon:</sup> <sub>Flying in abstraction dreams.</sub>
