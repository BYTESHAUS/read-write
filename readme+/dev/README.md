# The creation of software

**What makes software?** In a word - _development_, in four - \
[![Four colors of software](../pencraft/readme+/_rsc/_img/illus/dev/fromBlackCodeToGoldenArc.jpg)](../pencraft/readme+/_rsc/)\
<sup>:de:</sup> <sub>The colors were inspired by an informal interpretation of the German flag (_Schwarz-Rot-Gold_): from the dark past through the bloody present to the golden future.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since $(4>3)$ tearful-blue was added for design.</sub>

More colors? With due respect to administration, testing, DevOps, deployment, documentation, and project management, they could be only tints and shades of main paints. 

This layered picture won't classify even for [local imageboard](../../readme+/pencraft/readme+/opuses/IT-memes.md) but for a platform of further diagrams. Let's go.

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** show a blend of tied, overlapping, and time-unordered processes.&nbsp;<sup>:stop_button:</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:anchor:</sup> <sub>Digging deep in code mines, not seeing shining peaks.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:balloon:</sup> <sub>Flying in abstraction dreams.</sub>

I would have left this in the [memes](../pencraft/readme+/opuses/IT-memes.md) chapter unless had some more words for explanation.

## Overlapping and communication

</details>

Let's see them intermixed

### Persons, roles, or tasks? 

## Subtasks of design

To keep the design thinking (not necessarily implemented in every step)

## Worth of coding

Let's first formulate what the coding is and what different to dev.
Bugs lookup.

### Is there an architect as in Matrix?
