# Code - Documentation

## Comments

Comments can be eye-catching and essential but signal design inconsistency and poor naming.  Whereas [quality code](code-quality.md) is self-descriptive by nature and needs no text remarks<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>This statement is for high-level declarative languages.</sub>

Meanwhile, if you explore available sources such as GitHub, many (if not the majority) of the files there will be bloated with comments, which just rehears the names of classes, functions, arguments, and properties (along with copyright and other trivia).

However, comments are fully justified for:

+ weird workarounds (especially for third-party bugs),
+ courtesy of Q&A sites,
+ worthy tricks that harm readability,
+ code snippets in documentation,
+ domain-explaining quotes from sources like wiki.

Comments may contain text fragments, which will be compiled into documentation along with the application build (and directly refer to the code and serve as the help). This good idea requires much phantasy and stumbles on realization and maintenance.

## Diagrams and presentations

Applications in high-level languages are utmostly demonstrative in reverse engineering, but backward way isn't the best to learn (even with auto-generated diagrams and textual compilation).

Without a good file structure and quality code it will be a real headache. The ideas, intentions and spirit of design might differ.

Here the overall diagrams and presenations are rather handy.
