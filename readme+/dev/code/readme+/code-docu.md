# Code - Documentation

## Comments

Comments can be eye-catching and essential but signal design inconsistency and poor naming.  Whereas [quality code](code-quality.md) is self-descriptive by nature and needs no text remarks<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>This statement is for high-level declarative languages.</sub>

Meanwhile, if you explore available sources such as GitHub, many (if not the majority) of the files there will be bloated with comments, which just rehears the names of classes, functions, arguments, and properties along with trivia.

However, comments are fully justified for:

+ weird workarounds (e.g. for third-party bugs),
+ courtesy of Q&A sites,
+ worthy tricks that harm readability,
+ snippets in documentation,
+ domain-explaining quotes from sources like wiki.

Comments may contain documentation, which will be built along with the application and directly refer to the implementation. This good idea requires much phantasy and stumbles on realization and maintenance.

## Diagrams and presentations

You need both a good structure and quality code to get the concept of the application exploring but it's a reverse engineering ...

- perfect structure and code aren't
- the intention of application and design may deviate
