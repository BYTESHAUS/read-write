# Documentation of code

## Comments

Self-descriptive, clean codes need no comments<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>. Comments can be engaging and reliable but signal design flaws and poor naming.

If you explore available sources (such as GitHub), many of the codes there will be bloated with comments just repeating the names of classes, functions, and variables.

However, comments are fully justified for:

+ weird workarounds (e.g. for third-party bugs),
+ courtesy of Q&A sites,
+ worthy tricks that harm readability,
+ snippets in documentation,
+ domain-explaining quotes from sources like wiki.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>This statement is for high-level declarative languages.</sub>

Comments may contain documentation, which will be built along with the application and directly refer to the implementation. The idea is good but requires much phantasy and stumbles on realization and maintenance.
