# Software - External parts

What are cornerstones of new big project - tecnologies, tools, requirements, planning, team, budget? Neither. The fundamentals are already existing and proven concepts/components to adopt.

In software full-fledged third-party frameworks, libraries, services allow developers to focus on application business and UX rather than tame technologies, type and maintain tons of boilerplate code, test for and fix extra bugs.

Such external parts are mostly a click away from evaluation and range from-to:

* solo algorithm - browser engine,
* built-in source code - remote black-box service,
* lib calls - injecting into frameworks,
* open source and free - commercial and obfuscated,

Some entreprises can create much parts from scratch but are reluctant to re-invent the wheel (unless it's rounder than others or "security first").

## Core components

Integration of video/image-processing/3D/browsing/search is chiefly organic und undisputable.

## Frontend

Downright a must, met by more than experienced providers of suites, frameworks, controls for Rapid Application Development: Telerik, DevExpress, Google, Infragistics - to name a few.

Developers get the best out-of-the-box: state-of-the-art UI, professional look&feel, binding logical classes to place onto Model/ViewModel/Controller (with _table_ as the finest demanstrator).

## Backend

Simple to moderate applications need no elaborated structure - they begin with a little classes of data context. However for large projects teams shall weigh evaluation, learning curve and fitting of the chosen framework against own development.

Quite many frameworks are good at themselves but will burden your project with too much unclaimed "ballast" code.

## Testing

Successfull test frameworks (like JUnit, NUnit) are already associated with target languages/platforms and present in favorite IDEs.

## Free, commercial, open source, proprietary, initiative

Some non-commercial projects launched by individual or group have grown to industry standards and got adopted in mainstream languages. Remember [Newton.json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) which has for years filled the JSON gap in C#.
 
Nevertheless, when applying such 3d-party think if there's a community (maybe, only you) - able to maintain the stuff within lifecycles of using projects. Recall accomplished but abandoned [Iron Python](https://ironpython.net/) or prominent test mocks, last updated 10 years ago.

All-around pro solutions aren't free but annual dev licenses below $1K will quickly pay off even for an humble untertaking. Let alone live support and membership in durable motivated community.&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\
