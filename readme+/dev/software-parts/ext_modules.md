# Use of frameworks and libraries

Full-fledged 3d-party frameworks (libraries, packages) are a **vital**, "energy-saving" theme, which allows developers to focus on application business, design and UX rather than tame technologies, write tons of boilerplate code, fix bugs, update sources.

All-around pro solutions aren't free but annual dev licenses for selected platform below $1K will quickly pay off even in a small commercial project. Let alone live support and membership in durable motivated community.&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\

## Frontend

There's a healthy choice between more than experienced commercial and not providers of suites, frameworks, controls for Rapid Application Development: Telerik, Devexpress, Infragistics - to name a few.

You get the best out-of-the-box: state-of-the-art UI professional look&feel and thus don't re-invent the wheel (unless it's rounder than others).

## Backend

Simple to moderate applications need no elaborated structure - they start from few classes of the data context.

For any big project its team shall weigh evaluation and a steep learning curve of the adopted framework vs. own development.

Quite many frameworks are good at themselves but will load your project with too much unclaimed "ballast" code.

## Initiative projects

Some non-commercial projects launched by individual or group have grown to industry standards and got adopted in mainstream languages. Remember [Newton.json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
 
Nevertheless, when applying such 3d-party think if there's a community (maybe, only you) - able to maintain the project within its lifecycle. To show you what is meant, recall alive but pretty abandoned [Iron Python](https://ironpython.net/).
