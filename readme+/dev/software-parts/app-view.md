# Application view

View, as an interface to human sensors and actions in response, could be even not a sight but a voice assistant, or use other means of communication.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\

## Acceptance

No error, null or process behind shall break presentation or freeze a view without plausible feedback (e.g. perceptible start with animated splash screen).

A view, which loads enough remote data, must decently run even on bad connection. Trivial? Alas, not for some mail services.
