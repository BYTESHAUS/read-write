# Naming in software design

The naming of libraries, packages (assemblies), classes, methods and even non-public _vars_ **must** be a challenge and involve the whole team<sup>:family:</sup> discussions. This expense will pay off with:

+ collaboration, common comprehension of a domain that establishes a kind of *lingua franca* throughout the really being bound team
+ seasoned design and self-descriptive code
+ inspiration for behavior/domain driven design
+ escape from piles of requirements, specs, other papers that are hard to follow but easy to misunderstood, forget (but mostly neglected)
+ reduced efforts to get into a project for a newcomer 
+ comfy navigation within the source code (both by IDE's explorer and CTRL+F)

Even top developers under time pressure and brakes on perfectionism will name logics classes as *services*, *helpers*, *utils*, *handlers* but would 
be barely proud of that.
