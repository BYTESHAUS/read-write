# Code quality

Code quality is the cement of software. It's imperceptible for spectators, but ought to be of superior grade for high, heavy-duty, and complex constructions.

## High-quality code

That's _a)_ bug-unfriendly _b)_ reviewed/tested _c)_ _clean code_ that follows acknowledged guidelines and principles (e.g. SOLID) and also...

- [x] **reads** in both directions: the new developer will learn the domain from it while the domain expert (with some assistance) will grasp implemented business logic
- [x] **teaches** techniques and gimmicks
- [x] **inspires** to contribute to this code (rather than "it's better to rewrite that")

Concept of high-quality code is relative to \
|--- [Test Driven Design](../tdd-ddd.md) 

### Bug-unfriendly code

Even bug-**free** code can be bug-**prone**, while bug-unfriendly style minimizes the risk to introduce an error by change (no matter whether unit tests will pick one).

High-quality code has

+ syntax that prevents typos (in C# simple `string.Empty` instead of `""` and other [tricks](../.net/readme+/cs_hints.md))
+ sound logical flow: early return, shallow inclosures

### Test coverage

> Test coverage may (and shall) share the same functionality with TDD but is intended merely to mechanically examine software (no matter when written and run).

Efficient ample tests will patch buggy and badly joined applications, while good code doesn't need whole scale of automated scrutiny: unit, integration, performance testing.

However _errare humanum est_, and no test can harm the product. Quality of code allows to focus tests on ...

+ subjects of apparent changes
+ dependencies of imports and external parts
+ performance bottlenecks

... and avoid\

## P.S. Moralit√©

With all that said, why does mediocre code prevail and _clean code_ migrates to buzzwords? 

Primarily, poor-quality code is written much faster and cheaper. And as it does the job counter-arguments fade.

Benefits of quality code lag<sup>:family_man_woman_boy_boy:</sup> as well as exponentially growing issues from bad software parts. The point when controllable chaos goes out of uncontrol may be crucial but lay far in next releases.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:family_man_woman_boy_boy:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>for all beneficieries: users, customers, developers, project organizers</sub>

Not every developer will self-reflect on "submit and forget" work, and not every project management will draw a golden section between profanity and academism. 

## P.P.S. Mediocre code - why

Apart from environments where good code won't bloom<sup>:wilted_flower:</sup> or shall not be planted<sup>:desert:</sup> even motivated intelligent teams may not achieve high quality over a big project. To name few reasons:

+ overhead of formal processes at the expense of development and communication  
+ "egocentric" bias: low feedback (code review, pair programming, coaching) and reluctance to learn (also from critique)
+ over-creativity, unrestrained abstraction, pedantry/perfectionism, procrastination
+ cancelled iterations/refactoring
+ hesitation to use and contribute to shared code (from team/enterprise foundations up to open source)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:wilted_flower:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>budget/time jaws, code conveyors, unsuited teams, bad management</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:desert:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>prototypes, stand-alone auxiliaries, temporary solutions</sub>
