# Documentation of code

## Comments

Self-descriptive, clean codes need no comments, otherwise this signalizes flaws, foremost poor naming.\
However comments are fully liable for:

+ bizarre workarounds (e.g. for third-party bugs)
+ courtesy of Q&A sites
+ worthy tricks that harm readability
+ snippets in documentation
+ domain-explaining quotes from sources like wiki

## UML and similar diagrams

They are nice for concepts, discussion, top-level entries, but maintaining them on the class level is cumbersome (even when auto-generated).
The look at the good organized clean code must be enough.

## Manuals

Before you write a beautiful, good illustrated guide on software solution think on the following ad-lib alternative.
Just capture a screen for video overview of the code commenting it behind.
