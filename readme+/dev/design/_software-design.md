# Software design - private derivations

## "Design" or "Architecture"?

Major and long-time decisions on software implementation expressed in diagrams, modules, interfaces, classes, layers, hierarchies, and patterns - is it architecture or design?

With reverence for unknown architects of the Acropolis and Colosseum, I'd voluntarily reserve the term ___architecture___ for processor families, operating systems, global computing services, spectra of heterogeneous solutions, and IT science.<sup>:gear:</sup>

Whereas ___design___ suits much better applications<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>, even of enterprise scale. Software architecture implies tech-agnosticism (as with patterns), while the realization of requirements - particular tech stack, which can't be effectively ported on other rails.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:gear:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>You could have heard "architecture" addressed to _DevOps_, which also involves coding/scripting in other though neighboring terrain.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>Note the keyword - application. Use of somewhat developed over existing software platform for exact tasks.</sub>

## Objectives of design

Besides the primary specification of software entities, functions, and their [naming](/readme+/dev/code-naming.md/), concerns of design **are**:

+ detection of conceptual collisions<sup>:collision:</sup>,
+ [partitioning](/readme+/dev/software-parts/) (data, model, presentation, UI, biz logic),
+ use of [external](/readme+/dev/software-parts/ext_parts.md) libraries, frameworks, and services,
+ principal [language-specific decisions](.net/readme+/design)
+ planned audience (roles, groups), 
+ visualization and presentation of modeling (like UML sketches)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:collision:</sup> <sub>Both unrealistic expectations (as an AI-chat that will fully replace hotline operator, or crack of math problem) and technical bottlenecks (as hi-definition images processing in pure C# or obsolete user platforms).</sub>

and are **not**: 

- user experience (unless UI or UX is the application subject),
- tongues (unless it's a linguistic app) and assistance,
- versions of languages and platforms,
- ways of authentication/authorization,
- details of implementation, like sort algorithms,
- code and docu management (as management system choice),
- maintenance of design artifacts (docu).

## The role of the designer (architect)

I'd stick to the opinion that effective _design_ rests on direct and continuous involvement in _development_, at least as code reviews.

### Design vs. Development

First, let's put away *coding* when typewriting of known design decisions fills up gaps in automation or shortages in design.<sup>:open_hands:</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:open_hands:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>Quite reasonable when generation or great design will be too arduous.</sub>

The same code can emerge under the hat of the developer and designer. Then what is the edge between? 

Put simply: development resolves manifested design puzzles and plots, while design reveals new and cancels some previous. There's no edge since design and dev work intercepts much.

## Pitfalls

Besides trivial perfectionism, self-overestimate, and epic fails the next trivia often undermines the way of design:
