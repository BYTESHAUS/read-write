# The creation of software

**What makes software?** In a word - _development_, in four - \
[![Four colors of software](../,,/pencraft/readme+/_rsc/_img/illus/dev/fromDarkCodeToGoldenArc.jpg)](../../pencraft/readme+/_rsc/)\
<sup>:de:</sup> <sub>The colors were inspired by an informal interpretation of the German flag (_Schwarz-Rot-Gold_): from the dark past through the bloody present to the golden future.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since $4>3$ tearful-blue was added for design.</sub>

More colors? With due respect to administration, testing, DevOps, deployment, documentation, and project management, they could be only tints and shades of main paints. 

This layered picture won't qualify even for [local imageboard](../../pencraft/readme+/opuses/IT-memes.md) but was intended as a platform of further discussion. Let's go.

## Alltogether

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are a blend of tied, overlapping, and time-unordered processes.&nbsp;<sup>:stop_button:</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:anchor:</sup> <sub>Digging deep in code mines, not seeing shining peaks.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:balloon:</sup> <sub>Flying in abstraction dreams.</sub>

## Overlapping and communication

Let's see them intermixed

### Persons, roles, or tasks? 

## Subtasks of design

To keep the design thinking (not necessarily implemented in every step)

## Worth of coding

Let's first formulate what the coding is and what different to dev.
Bugs lookup.

### Is there an architect as in Matrix?



# Design - private derivations

## Duties and purposes

Besides the primary specification of software layers, modules, entities, functions, and their [naming](/readme+/dev/design/readme+/code-naming.md/), concerns of design **are**:

+ detection of conceptual collisions<sup>:collision:</sup>,
+ [partitioning](/readme+/dev/design/readme+/software-parts/) (data, model, presentation, UI, biz logic),
+ use of [external](/readme+/dev/design/readme+/software-parts/ext_parts.md) libraries, frameworks, and services,
+ principal language-specific decisions,&nbsp;âœ‹
+ planned audience (roles, groups), 
+ visualization and presentation of modeling (like UML sketches)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:collision:</sup> <sub>Both unrealistic expectations (as an AI-chat that will fully replace hotline operator, or crack of math problem) and technical bottlenecks (as hi-definition images processing in pure C# or obsolete user platforms).</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>âœ‹</sup> <sub>I share my C# decisions in [use-dev](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev).</sub>

and are **not**: 

- user experience (unless UI or UX is the application subject),
- tongues (unless it's a linguistic app) and assistance,
- versions of languages and platforms,
- ways of authentication/authorization,
- details of implementation, like sort algorithms,
- code and docu management (as management system choice),
- maintenance of design artifacts (docu).

## Options of design

* maintenance of acquired or imaginative [design samples](readme+/design_samples.md)

## Pitfalls

Besides trivial perfectionism, self-overestimate, and epic fails the next trivia often undermines the way of design:
