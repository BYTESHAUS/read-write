# Design - private derivations

## Duties and purposes

Besides the primary specification of software layers, modules, entities, functions, and their [naming](/readme+/dev/design/readme+/code-naming.md/), concerns of design **are**:

+ detection of conceptual collisions<sup>:collision:</sup>,
+ [partitioning](/readme+/dev/software-parts/) (data, model, presentation, UI, biz logic),
+ use of [external](/readme+/dev/software-parts/ext_parts.md) libraries, frameworks, and services,
+ principal [language-specific decisions](.net/readme+/design)
+ planned audience (roles, groups), 
+ visualization and presentation of modeling (like UML sketches)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:collision:</sup> <sub>Both unrealistic expectations (as an AI-chat that will fully replace hotline operator, or crack of math problem) and technical bottlenecks (as hi-definition images processing in pure C# or obsolete user platforms).</sub>

and are **not**: 

- user experience (unless UI or UX is the application subject),
- tongues (unless it's a linguistic app) and assistance,
- versions of languages and platforms,
- ways of authentication/authorization,
- details of implementation, like sort algorithms,
- code and docu management (as management system choice),
- maintenance of design artifacts (docu).

## Options of design

* maintenance of acquired or imaginative [design samples](readme+/design_samples.md)

## Pitfalls

Besides trivial perfectionism, self-overestimate, and epic fails the next trivia often undermines the way of design:
