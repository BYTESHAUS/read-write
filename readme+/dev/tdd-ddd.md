# Driven design - TDD on DDD

## TDD (Test Driven Design)

Simplicity and versatility makes **TDD** superb for insight of vague topics (that is almost any new development). 

It's simple because needs neither special skills nor prescribed processes, while popular and mostly free unit-test libraries are enough to start.\
It's versatile since can be applied in any extent and direction, mock and stub anything or rely on real data.

The purpose of TDD is no way test automation but means to
+ grope **concepts** and get hands-on feeling on subjects (be it bookkeeping routines or starship model)
+ vitalize skeleton **functionality** and evaluate trends with risks
+ couple design dreams with reality of programming possibilities

Optionally:
+ define **test framework** of the application

TDD renders good stuff for test coverage while are written in a good black-box manner, not influenced by implementation.

## DDD (Design Driven Design)

TDD and **D**omain **D**riven **D**esign are a perfect match and will boost each other. Putting _design hat_ on will draught domain objects, their functions and relations, which one wearing _"test" hat_ will mock and stub with rational feedback.

## Tests as entry point to application

It's not enough to write greatly developed and effective tests, which nobody will explore unless they get unfathomably red.

A novice shall
+ promptly find tests and appreciate their naming and categorization
+ learn the application buy viewing and running them

Project "masters"
+ begin any change with tests
+ care that even a non-programmer may comprehend tests
