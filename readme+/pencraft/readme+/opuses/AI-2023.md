# Artificial Intelligence - 2023 - Much ado about ... fussing?

AI is on trend, again, and you can't dodge this "IntelliSteampunk" festival - it's in every other IT lecture, article, or product release.  Torrents of AI news have urged prominent software engineers, and tech leads [think of a dam](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) for [AI dystopia](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-extinction-risk-openai-deepmind-anthropic-ceos-sam-altman-2023-5), while other up-to-date visions are:

<details>
<summary><ins>&nbsp;Impressive and inspiring&nbsp;</ins></summary>
&nbsp;

* *Sundar Pichai*, Google CEO:\
"AI is the most profound technology humanity is working on today."
* *Jensen Huang*, CEO of NVIDIA:\
"Software is eating the world, but AI is going to eat software."
* MkCinsey & Company:\
"Generative AI’s impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars [annually]..."
* *Ray Kurzweil*, inventor and futurist:\
"By 2029, computers will have emotional intelligence and be convincing as people."
* _Giles Pendleton,_ executive director of NEOM ($500 billion project):\
"The linear city will be “assembled” using artificial intelligence."
* [and how without him] *Elon Musk*, xAI startup founder:\
"The goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe."

&nbsp;

These required much more search than the quotes above ...

* *Ginni Rometty*, former CEO of IBM\
"Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence."

* _Christopher Nolan_, filmmaker, questioned about AI in a 2023 interview:\
"... the real world is, by definition, infinitely complex. ... And so, any digital simulation or technology that simulates, eventually, it always hits a particular limitation."

* _Michael Atleson_, Attorney, Federal Trade Commission, 27/Feb/2023:\
"Keep your AI claims in check."

## Stumbling block

Neither philosophy nor exact sciences nor neurobiology can formulate _intelligence_. Its genesis and individual rise are a bigger mystery. 
Digitalization speaks in clear definitions - and there are none.<sup>⚙️</sup>

Adepts of the bright and dismal AI future readily assume its *self-knowledge/awareness* as a trivial matter of time. 
To either brew by itself in increasingly complex code bouillon or get all of a sudden [short circuited](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949)<sup>:cinema:</sup>.

Digital tech fantastically and reliably automates much of hard cogitative ops (where humans are slow, prone to errors, lack parallelism, and get distracted or frustrated), but not unformalizable processes - abstraction, (self-)criticism, motivation - which are preconditions of great breakthroughs in exact sciences<sup>:art:</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>⚙️</sup> <sub>Publicized views of decision-making as a relay work of neurons preset by acquired knowledge is a super-profanation of free will debate.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:art:</sup> <sub>In non-exact studies and art too, but it's not that evident and requires a separate parsing.</sub>

## Evidence

You can think up a CAPTCHA, which a diligent fellow will promptly pass but "AI" (with or without Internet access) may only exhaust unless you limit attempts.

The progress of computer powers allowed assisted mathematical proofs, impossible before. However, no AI-bot with all the computing power in the world can solve  an open mathematical problem.<sup>:1234:</sup> Humans do.<sup>:scientist:</sup>

A chess app on a discarded hand-held device will smash any grandmaster but no AI will generate a better engine than hominid<sup>♟️</sup>.

IDEs and assists strongly boost dev productivity, but if any AI claims to write the code, then it will be either a snippet or you need to describe the requirements in detail close to operators.

There's human assistance behind many AI tricks (either individual tuning or "machine learning" by thousands in low-rate offshore)<sup>:man_facepalming:</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:1234:</sup> <sub>Conditions for many are plain and unambivalent enough to formulate in XML.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:scientist:</sup> <sub>As _Grigori Perelman_ with one of the seven _Millenium Problems_.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>♟️</sup> <sub>_Stockfish_ at the moment, but could be ancient IBM Deep Blue or even Deep Thought.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:man_facepalming:</sup> <sub>Do you remember machine learning of [Mechanical Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk)?</sub>

## Conclusion

**First and foremost** AI is much a voguish theme and publicity of all kinds, but not mere hype and chimera. There are new generation data processing and storage behind<sup>:hammer_and_wrench:</sup>, but neither is "intelligent" since smart heads have programmed them.

You may charge me with shallow judgments but searching for the theme I found the same-level presentations - beautiful (no sarcasm), futuristic but overall. (Compare to hash functions on pure math which had silently revolutionalized IT.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:hammer_and_wrench:</sup> <sub>Processing vast amounts of data in real-time, finding patterns there; image/video on-the-fly filtering and recognition; routine translation and text generation</sub>

## Appendix. Preceding AI tides

Grunting "again"<sup>:top:</sup> obliges me to recall a few AI booms, impromptu and without wiki. I'd skip old fiction and the times when man humanized mechanical breakthroughs, and resume on the digital era.

### 1950s

The crucial IT decade ever - an energized racks of metals, glass, and vacuum replaced hives of handmade calculations, and avid scientists elaborated impressive HMIs with high-level languages. 

The leap in both hardware and software could surpass the wildest phantasies. And two letters made folks think that processors will soon be peers of human brains.

<summary><ins>&nbsp;These two letters were not 'AI' but ...&nbsp;</ins></summary>
&nbsp;
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**IF** -- This statement in high-level languages introduced the feeling of human doubt and decision-making.

### 1970s

Computers gradually spread from science calculations to business (with a much greater audience), and robotics delivered funny androids. 

In chess, with its intellectual aura, computer programs (not for cheat but experiment) could give winning hints that grandmasters couldn't discern and had attributed to the abrupt progress of their inferior opponents.<sup>:game_die:</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:game_die:</sup> <sub>It's AlphaGo in 2023 for another strategy game, since a computer could defeat a chess WM in 1997.</sub>

### Late 1980s - early 1990s

PCs have become a mass factor at work and home. Thousands of enthusiasts, fascinated by the might and ease of programming, along with top engineers, which one could hire then for symbolic rates, tried to reanimate AI.

A side-effect of that kick was the emergence of pseudo-sciences like _the theory of inventive problem-solving_.

### 2023

And here we are, when _there will be no (human) programmers in five years_<sup>:one:</sup>. No fear, thanks to AI _you'll have universal high income_<sup>:two:</sup>, and _AI can now make you immortal_<sup>:three:</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:one:</sup> <sub>*Emad Mostaque*, CEO of Stability AI, 2023</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:two:</sup> <sub>_Elon Musk_ again, Nov 3, 2023</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:three:</sup> <sub>_Bernard Marr_, Forbes, Feb 21, 2023 </sub>
