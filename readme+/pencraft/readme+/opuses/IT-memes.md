The genuine in this pseudo-wisdom is that no other knowledge changes so quickly as the IT tech stack. Javascript/HTML, which one learned in 2000, remains only as basic syntax. It went through libs, polyfills, jQuery, and other cool tools and at the moment transformed into single-page frameworks.

**Solution?**

> Don't swim against the current. Stay in the river, become the river; and the river is already going to the sea. This is the great teaching.\
â€” Rajneesh, aka Osho (1931-1990

Translated east-to-west this means: find a sinecure in a big corporation.
