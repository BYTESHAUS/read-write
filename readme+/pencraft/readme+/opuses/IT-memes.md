The grains of truth in this wisdom:

* No other knowledge erodes so quickly as the IT tech stack - languages/scripts, markup, frameworks, and their IDEs, UX styles (sub)emerge, and mutate annually.<sup>:violin:</sup>
* In the horizontal dimension a developer can't stick to a favorite language and must be competent in a wide techno spectrum.

**Solution?**

> Don't swim against the current. Stay in the river, become the river; and the river is already going to the sea. This is the great teaching.\
‚Äî Rajneesh, aka Osho (1931-1990
