The grain of truth in this wisdom is that 

* No other knowledge erodes so quickly as the IT tech stack - languages, markup, frameworks, UX guidelines, and their IDEs (sub)emerge, and mutate annually.<sup>:violin:</sup>
* In the horizontal dimension a developer can't stick to a favorite syntax and must be competent with a wide tech stack.
