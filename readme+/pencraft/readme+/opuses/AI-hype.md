# Arteficial Intelligence - Much ado about ... marketing?

Artificial Intelligence is a hot theme in 2023, again. 
"AI" and "ChatGPT" saturate the program of the summer digital festival in my city  (every other lecture names them).

Its pace must be that giant that some scientists, prominent software engineers, and tech leads [search for a break pedal](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/). Besides scaring other visions divide into:

Rare find, not on the first page of the search output but ...

* *Ginni Rometty*, CEO of IBM\
Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.\

* _Christopher Nolan_, filmmaker, questioned about AI in 2023:\
... the real world is, by definition, infinitely complex. ... And so, any digital simulation or technology that simulates, eventually, it always hits a particular limitation.

## Intelligence

Neither philosophy nor exact sciences formulate _intelligence_, and its genesis is a greater mystery.

Enough for me to see AI as rather a buzzword than technology. IntelliSteampunk?
