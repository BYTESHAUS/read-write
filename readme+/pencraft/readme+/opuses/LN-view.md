# Lotus Notes - "This used to be my playground"

> As both a user and developer of Lotus Notes for over a decade (before .NET engagement), I must have deserved the privilege of personal (Lotus) notes.

IBM PC users remember (or not), that it was a time and a **word**, not Microsoft's one, but "Lotus" - a synonym for spreadsheet, text processor, calendar, E-Mail client, and collaboration tools.

_Lotus Notes_ (henceforth also _LN_), released at the turn of 1991, crowned the family. This multiplatform groupware of core value paved the public road to diverse IT innovations: client-server, access scheme, doc-oriented DB, and replication, to name a few.

There were similar suites - legacy, alternative, or tailor-made - but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden ... until Microsoft began to broadly win its chunks of office software.

In 1995, IBM gained Lotus in full<sup>:moneybag:</sup>. It was a unique chance not only to push the product family further across corporations but also to reform at least LN with the power, know-how, and technologies of the Big Blue. Mediocre efforts for the latter caused Lotus to wilt.

In 2001 Microsoft released its SharePoint<sup>:writing_hand:</sup> = a much more complex and bulkier competitor, which nevertheless gradually superseded LN in one-way traffic because of:

* overlay of LN functionality,
* freedom from many LN inborn deficiencies (e.g. backed by MS SQL),
* primary Web client,
* inherent integration of other MS benchmark products (e.g. office tools),
* better support (e.g. learning resources),
* state-of-the-art dev environment (.NET).

The bargain sale of Domino/Notes and donating office source code to freeware put the _full stop_ of the story. (Jence LN remains on the IT margins as legacy)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:moneybag:</sup> <sub>For a $3.5 billion - not a big deal nowadays, while made well before IT procurements had skyrocketed at the end of the 1990s.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:writing_hand:</sup> <sub>Proprietary development contrary to purchased Dynamics</sub>\

## Epilogue



## Appendix. Rich premises and missed opportunities

Lotus Notes joined the best of academic IT from the 1980s with the youthful practices of the 1990s. However, its good sides had enough critical downsides, as you can evaluate below.

### Document model and storage

Long before NoSQL<sup>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</sup> became a hit LN proposed the developers to work with.

The shortage was that the storage resided on 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:writing_hand:</sup> <sub>Developed from scratch contrary to purchased Dynamics.</sub>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</sup> <sub>Not Only SQL</sub>

### Client-server

HTTP add-on for Notes Server since 1996

### User access

Certification.

### Programming

Rapid application development. Forms definition.

Easy entry

Barely extendible

Lotus took LotusScript - LN native language - contained API, with some lines of code enough to get into LN objects. There was nothing bad in the language were LN API, but it was Visual Basic. Good enough for 1990s, but poor in 2000s

The main handicap was LotusScript.

Specific Java and C++ API.

### Administration

Notes/Domino

### Replication

My personal choice of LN good parts as Nr 1. 
Online vs. offline (compare to Git model)

## Missed opportunities

The good sides of LN had their downsides. Fails to ELIMINATE them 

### Loose database model

Integration with DB2. For the normal (the concept supported naturally by SharePoint).

It was the right plan to integrate LN with IBM DB2 but it failed.

### Web applications

Domino server did not become an HTTP server of choice and remained only for serving LN applications.

### Product quality

Within the overlap of my switch from LN to .NET, I definitely experienced: beta versions of Visual Studio 2010 crashed less often than the release of Notes Designer.

Rumors told that offshore development of LN products had much lowered the bar.

> Let me finish with the quote from another hit - _Now I know what made Lotus blue_. Seriously, I was pretty sure that _Lotus_ until [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_I_Know_What_Made_Otis_Blue). Enough said about my involvement.
