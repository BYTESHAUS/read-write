# Lotus Notes - "This used to be my playground"

> As both a user and developer of Lotus Notes for over a decade (before .NET engagement), I must have deserved a right to personal (Lotus) notes.

IBM PC users remember (or not), that it was a time and a **word**, not Microsoft's one, but "Lotus" - a synonym for spreadsheet, text processor, calendar, E-Mail client, and collaboration tools.

_Lotus Notes_ (henceforth also _LN_), released at the turn of 1991, crowned the family. This groupware of core value paved the public road to diverse IT innovations: client-server, access scheme, doc-oriented DB, and replication, to name a few.

There were similar suites - legacy, alternative, or tailor-made - but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden (until Microsoft began to broadly win its chunks of office software).

In 1995, IBM gained Lotus in full<sup>:moneybag:</sup>. It was a unique chance not only to push the product family further across corporations but also to reform at least LN with the power, know-how, and technologies of the Big Blue. Mediocre efforts for the latter caused Lotus to wilt.

In 2001 Microsoft released its SharePoint<sup>:writing_hand:</sup>, a much more complex and bulkier competitor, nevertheless deprived of much LN inborn deficiencies and inherently coupled with other products from Redmond WA (already benchmarks at that time). 

SharePoint gradually superseded LN in one-way traffic. The bargain sale of Domino/Notes and donating office source code to freeware put the _full stop_ of the story. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:moneybag:</sup> <sub>For a $3.5 billion - not a big deal nowadays, while made well before IT procurements had skyrocketed at the end of the 1990s.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:writing_hand:</sup> <sub>Developed from scratch contrary to purchased Dynamics.</sub>

## The good sides

Lotus Notes united the best of academic IT from the 1980s and the practices of the 1990s, and issued mainstream IT solutions as a result.


### Client-server

Web added in 1996

### Straight model and storage

Long before NoSQL<sup>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</sup> became the hit LN proposed the developers to work with.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</sup> <sub>Not Only SQL</sub>


### Rapid application development


### Administration

Notes/Domino

### Replication

My personal choice of LN good parts as Nr 1. 
Online vs. offline (compare to Git model)

## Missed opportunities

The good sides of LN had their downsides

### Loose database model

Integration with DB2. For the normal (the concept supported naturally by SharePoint).

### Lagging programming facilities

LotusScript - LN native language - contained API, with some lines of code enough to get into LN objects. There was nothing bad in the language were LN API, but it was Visual Basic. Good enough for 1990s, but poor in 2000s

Specific Java and C++ API.

### Insufficient facilities for web

### Product quality

Within the overlap of my switch from LN to .NET I had definitely experienced: the beta version of Visual Studio 2010 had crashed less often than the release of Notes Designer.

Rumors told that offshore development of LN products had much lowered the bar.

## Epilogue

Let me finish with the quote from another hit - _Now I know what made Lotus blue_. Seriously, I was pretty sure that _Lotus_ until [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_I_Know_What_Made_Otis_Blue). Enough said about my involvement.
