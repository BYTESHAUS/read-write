# Lotus Notes - "This used to be my playground"

> As both a user and developer of Lotus Notes for over a decade (till changed to .NET), I must have deserved a right to personal (Lotus) notes.

IBM PC users remember (or not), that it was a time and a **word**, not Microsoft's one, but "Lotus" - a synonym for spreadsheet, text processor, calendar, E-Mail client, and collaboration tools.

_Lotus Notes_ (henceforth also _LN_), released at the turn of 1991, crowned the family. This groupware of core value paved the public road to many innovations: client-server, certification/authentification/authorization, doc-oriented DBs, and replication, to name a few.

There were similar suites - legacy, alternative, or tailor-made - but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden ... until Microsoft began to broadly win its chunks of office software.

In 1995, IBM gained Lotus in full<sup>:moneybag:</sup>. It was a unique chance not only to push the product family further across corporate clients but also to rebuild at least LN with the power and technologies of the Big Blue. Attempts for the latter were mediocre, and Lotus began to wilt.

In 2001 Microsoft released its SharePoint<sup>:writing_hand:</sup>, a much more complex and bulkier competitor, nevertheless deprived of much LN inborn deficiencies and inherently coupled with other MS products (already benchmarks at that time). 

SharePoint gradually superseded LN in one-way traffic. The bargain sale of Domino/Notes and donating office source code to freeware put the _full stop_ of the story. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:moneybag:</sup> <sub>For a $3.5 billion - not a big deal nowadays, while made well before IT procurements had skyrocketed at the end of the 1990s.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:writing_hand:</sup> <sub>Developed from scratch contrary to purchased Dynamics.</sub>

## Good assets

Lotus Notes took the best of the practices from the 1980s-1990s and brought unique solutions such as replication and document-oriented databases. RAD, Client-server, asymmetric encryption.

### Straight document model

Long before NoSQL (pronounced, not only SEQL) became the factor.

### Replication

My personal choice of LN good parts Nr 1. 
Online vs. offline (compare to Git model)

### Rapid application development


## Administration

Notes/Domino


## Missed opportunities

Notes quite


### Product quality



## Epilogue

Let me finish with the quote from another hit - _Now I know what made Lotus blue_. Seriously, I was pretty sure that _Lotus_ until [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_I_Know_What_Made_Otis_Blue). Enough said about my involvement.
