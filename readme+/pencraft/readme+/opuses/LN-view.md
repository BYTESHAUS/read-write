# Personal reminiscence of Lotus Notes

This is a typical story of a product, from mainstream moved to the margins - from a personal perspective. 

### Short history

There were times when text editor, spreadsheet, E-Mail client, and collaborative software were associated with the word _Lotus_.

IBM times

Now. Steady migration to SharePoint since 2010.

### Good parts

Pioneer in Client Server u.a.

Replication - also easy collaboration work

 NoSQL DB

Web client!


### Bad parts - Reasons undergone

NO INTEGRATION of DB2

LotusScript as main language (compare to VB vs. C#), neglected Java (specifics and delay with version support)

Unstable clients (Designer vs. VS 2010)

Lack of docu (IBM vs MS)
