# Lotus Notes - "This used to be my playground"

> As a user and developer of Lotus Notes for over a decade (before going .NET), I must have deserved the privilege of personal (Lotus) notes.

IBM PC users remember (or not), that it was a time and a **word**, not Microsoft's one, but "Lotus" - a synonym for spreadsheet, text processor, calendar, E-Mail client, and collaboration tools.

The multiplatform groupware _Lotus Notes_, released at the turn of 1991, joined the best of academic IT from the 1980s with the youthful practices of the 1990s and promptly became of core value. 

Lotus Notes (henceforth also _LN_) paved the public road to diverse innovations: client-server, multirole/group certified access, doc-oriented DB, __**replication**__<sup>:star:</sup>, to name a few unique goodies.

Devs and admins will mention authentic Rapid Application Development with clear installation/evaluation<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>.

Definitely, there were similar suites - legacy, alternative, or tailor-made - but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden ... until Microsoft began to broadly win its chunks of office software.

In 1995, IBM gained Lotus in full<sup>:moneybag:</sup>. It was a big chance not only to gain from internal use and sales but also to reform at least LN with the power, know-how, and technologies of the Big Blue. Mediocre and inaccurately focused efforts for the latter caused Lotus to wilt<sup>:icecream:</sup>.

In 2001 Microsoft delivered a much more complex and bulkier competitor. **SharePoint**, nevertheless, gradually superseded LN in one-way traffic since was deprived of the inherent vices of the Lotus pioneer and presented the next software generation as a product and API. 

The bargain sale of Domino/Notes and donating office source code to freeware put the _full stop_ of the story. (From this time on LN paced to a legacy on the IT margins.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:star:</sup> <sub>Emphasized for rare ease, versatility, productivity, and robustness. Besides synchronizing DBs it allowed to seamlessly use/develop LN offline, guarantee messaging, and merge design much simpler than in Git or TFS.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>I can't imagine a newbie installing SharePoint on a notebook and writing the first useful application within a week.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:moneybag:</sup> <sub>For a $3.5 billion - not a big deal nowadays, while made well before IT procurements had skyrocketed at the end of the 1990s.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:icecream:</sup> <sub>It's not a secret that IBM gave the cold shoulder to Lotus _laissez-faire_, urging many top devs to leave.</sub>.

## Alternative history

It does not much sense to discuss the downsides of LN and the reasons it surrendered to the rival from Redmond, WA. Let's imagine how could survived LN look today.

+ **Storage as mature object-relational model** \
   IBM DB2. <sup>:cd:</sup> For LN developer
+ **Single-Page Web-Application as the only user client**\
Eliminating desktop premises and @formula language\
Though Notes Server supported HTTP rendering of applications since 1996
+ **Integration of updated tools**\
  compare _Word_ and _Excel_ with Lotus peers
+ **State-of-the-art dev ecosystem**\
 Java vs. LotusScript, 
+ **Better learning resources**

**Last but not least**, _Notes_ foundation could attract top pro and liable forces and community to fulfill this wishlist and prevent quality degradation<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup> <sub>During the overlap of my switch from LN to .NET, I definitely experienced: beta versions of Visual Studio 2010 crashed less often than the release of Notes Designer.</sub>

> Let me finish with the quote from another hit - _Now I know what made Lotus blue_. Seriously, I was pretty sure that _Lotus_ until [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_I_Know_What_Made_Otis_Blue). Enough said about my involvement.
