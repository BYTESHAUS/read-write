# Artisctic and other non-code resources in repositories

Non-code materials in repositories, created under this profile contain diverse pictures, snapshots, schemes, quotes, wiki references, and other borrowings.

## Own resources

// ToDo: description

You can reproduce my resources as a collage or meme (also re-worked) when explicitly attributing them to my profile on GitHub.

## External resources

* For illustrative purposes only
* Fair use
* Non-commercial
* For illustrative and entertaining purposes

When possible I refer the source or/and attribute to the author. 

// ToDo: formalize clauses

## Miscellaneous

I couldn't trace sources of certain images/texts (albeit archaeologists say that the source of any meme can be found in cuneiform.). Some memes are too folk and public.

## Conclusion

Yours sincerely, owner of github.com/Kyriosity (Kyrill D).

If you have questions or demands, please contact me by committing to one of the repositories.
