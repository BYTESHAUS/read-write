# Artisctic and other non-code resources in repositories

Non-code materials in repositories here contain diverse pictures, snapshots, schemes, quotes, wiki references, and other borrowings. Some are directly contributed.

## Own resources

You can reproduce resources, that I contributed, as a collage or meme (also reworked), when explicitly attributing them to my profile on GitHub.

## External resources

* For illustrative and entertaining purposes
* Fair use
* Non-commercial
* For very limited auditorium

When possible I refer the source or/and attribute to the author. 

## Miscellaneous

I couldn't trace sources of certain images/texts (archaeologists say that the source of any meme can be found in cuneiform.). Some memes are too folk and public.

## Conclusion

Yours sincerely, owner of github.com/Kyriosity (Kyrill D).

If you have questions or demands, don't hesitate to get in touch with me by committing to one of the repositories.
