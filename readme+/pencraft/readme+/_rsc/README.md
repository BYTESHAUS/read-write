# Artisctic and other non-code resources in repositories

Non-code stuff in repositories here contains diverse pictures, snapshots, schemes, quotes, wiki references, and other materials: borrowed (from 3d parties) and own.

## Own resources

Resources such as collages, memes, or texts, contributed by repository owner(s), can be reproduced without permission but explicitly referencing to the GitHub profile.

## External resources

* For illustrative and entertaining purposes
* Fair use
* Non-commercial
* For very limited auditorium

When possible I refer the source or/and attribute to the author.

## Miscellaneous

I couldn't trace sources of certain images/texts (archaeologists say that the source of any can be found in cuneiform.). Some memes are too folk and public to have personal ownership or copyright.

## Conclusion

Yours sincerely, owner of github.com/Kyriosity (Kyrill D).

If you have questions or demands, don't hesitate to contact me by committing to one of the repositories. Hope to hear from you.
