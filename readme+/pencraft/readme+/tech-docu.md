# Technical documentation

## Input

Before writing from scratch evaluate amd adjust following sources for docu output:

### Similar material 

Previous version, description of similar product. It could be even other's _magnum opus_ which owner may legalize "plagiarism" just for refernce and thanks.

### Requirements

Writing and maintaing requirements is the concern of project management. Albeit there could be none in episcular form.

### Tracking, versioning systems

A tracking system may collect and generate documentation with a good degree of automation ().

## Contribution to guidelines

**Split the flow.** Long-running sentences and paragraphs are first-degree misdemeanours.

Except citations use quotation marks for metaphors while _italic_ to introduce terms. Example:
> To compare _Multitasking_ vs. _parallelism_ think computer as a "kitchen" where a quick cook or orderly brigade can prepare the same food.


**Last but not least**, do not only take advantage of automation (content management) and docu templating but contribute to it with each writing, taking more than a page.
