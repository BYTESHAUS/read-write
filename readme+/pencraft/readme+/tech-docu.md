# Technical documentation

## Input

Before writing from scratch evaluate and adjust the following sources for docu output:

### Similar material 

Any previous version, description of a similar product. It could be even others' magnum opus_ which owner may legalize "plagiarism" just for reference and thanks.

### Requirements

Writing and maintaining requirements must concern project management. Albeit there could be none in epistolary form.

### Tracking, versioning systems

A tracking system may collect and generate documentation with a good degree of automation ().

## Contribution to guidelines

+ **Split the flow.** Long-running sentences and paragraphs are first-degree misdemeanors.

+ Except for citations use quotation marks for metaphors while _italic_ to introduce terms. Example:
> To compare _multitasking_ vs. _parallelism_ imagine the CPU being a "kitchen" where a quick cook or orderly brigade can prepare the same food.

+ **Last but not least**, do not only take advantage of automation (content management) and docu templating but contribute to it with each writing, longer than a page.
