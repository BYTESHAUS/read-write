# Technical writing

__Documentation__ and __authoring__ are two differing employments of writing skills with opposed values of formalism, creativity, imagination, styles. Their principled distinction is __*driven*__ vs __*drives*__.

Documentation is **on-demand/request** derivative of a product, must follow structure and sentence patterns and shall be (auto-)generated as much as possible. Strict _User manual_ of hazardous tool is an exemplary case.

Authoring is **voluntary** and must take a higher view of the subject, inspire and explain sophisticated or formal ideas in abstractive friendly (sometimes informal) fashion. Much of renowned works (as about REST) were based on ideas (not public implementations).

Irregardless of missions any tech writing is an expensive exercise and thus:
+ must have an auditorium,
+ be the best among other ways of learning (consider quickly sketched presentation, captured video-tutorial, watercooler talks),
+ be long-term (maintained and evolved)
