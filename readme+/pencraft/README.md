# Technical writing

__Documentation__ and __authoring__ are two differing employments of technical writing with opposed values of formalism, creativity, imagination, styles. Their principled distinction is __*driven*__ vs __*drives*__.

Documentation is on-demand derivative of a product, must follow structure and sentence patterns and shall be (auto-)generated as much as possible. Tecnical reference of a tool is exemplar tech docu.

Authoring is voluntary and must take a higher view of the subject, inspire and explain friendly (sometimes informal) sophisticated or formal ideas.

Irregardless of the mission any tech writing is an expensive exercise and thus:
+ must have an auditorium,
+ be the best among other ways of learning (e.g. video-tutorial),
+ be long-term (maintained and evolved)
