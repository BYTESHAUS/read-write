# Technical writing

Technical writing must be seen in two differing adaptations - **documentation** and **authoring** - with opposed values of formalism, creativity, imagination, style.

Nevertheless the major difference is *driven* (docu) __*vs.*__ *drives* (authoring). Documentation is derived and must desribe a product *pro forma*. Authoring must take a higher view of the subject, inspire and explain complex or formal ideas in human readable form.

Irregardless of the mission any tech writing must acquit the resources:
+ has an auditorium,
+ has no easier alternative,
+ be long-term
