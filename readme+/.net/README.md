# Subjective about C#

C# on .NET deserves to be noted as one of the most **eloquent** and **all-around** languages/platforms for business applications. It's a flagship of Microsoft (enough said), where the ship is .NET and the flag is C#.

It evolves nonstop, providing us with up-to-date, concise, comprehensible syntax and incredible features ([LINQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321724/where-can-i-get-a-good-concise-linq-cheatsheet), [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl), [Rx.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) i.a.).\
Its team learns from the drawbacks and advantages of other languages, community [proposals](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/proposals), and picks trade-offs between readability and brevity.
 
C# allows developers to focus on clean code while .NET will take care of compiling that into effective and safe executables. The cleaner the code - the better performance.

Surprisingly C# is widely utilized in APIs and drivers to industry-standard embedded software (i.a. automotive and machinery).
