# C# - Nice to have - Parts and frameworks

Along with [nice-to-have syntax/features](cs-lacks.md) I could imagine external but "natural" parts/frameworks, to make C# even greater.

## Testing

The prevailing attitude to testing is as an integral part of the software
You may object ...

## Measurement systems

Definition of natural values (geometry, masses, temperature, electricity, movement u.a.) and their conversions between systems of measurements (metric, US customary, UK imperial u.a.) are more than essential tools (e.g., Celsius-Fahrenheit-Kelvin).

I've outlined custom [Typescript framework](../../../../../../../convert-smth) but hope that Microsoft one day will promote a sound multi-platform pluggable<sup>:electric_plug:</sup> framework.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:electric_plug:</sup> <sub> Since no framework will cover all diversities of physical values and systems (especially custom), and there must be "templates" to add own definitions.</sub>

Meanwhile, you may try and extend [C# Multifaceted-Value](../../../../../../../use-dev/) to organize units in your applications.

## Lingua
Let's take some output from fictitious tree search `$"Branches: {found}, â‰¥ leaves: {cutoff}"`. That can be quickly refactored for narrative or voice generator:\
`$"{found} {(1 == found ? "branch has" : "branches have")} no less than {cutoff} {(1 == cutoff ? "leaf" : "leaves")}"`

If an application generates much multi-language text it won't be a big deal to implement

```csharp
namespace Lingua.Grammar;

interface INumbered
{
    string Count(long num);
    string Count(double num);
}

interface IPluralForms {
    INumbered Plural((string singular, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Dual((string singular, string dual, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Trial((string singular, string dual, string trial, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Paucal((string singular, string paucal, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Custom(string[] forms, Func<long, int> indexWhole, Func<double, int>? indexFractional = null);
}
```

However
- this reinvents the wheel,
- there are other forms of grammatical numbers besides plurals,
- numbering is only a share of grammatical agreements in every single tongue,
- linguistics goes far beyond competence in a few tongue families.

And what if .NET foundation classes could:
- neatly formulate declensions, conjugation, and other formations,
- define constants for unfamiliar forms of loanwords (greek, Latin u.a.),
- revise habitual [CultureInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo) (classify tongue families and default agreements)

And, not least, add syntax sugar like

<details>
<summary><b>Proposal for grammar interpolation</b></summary>
&nbsp;&nbsp;`${number [: [format] : [forms] : []] }`, where

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*number* is whole or fractional subject\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*format* specifies usual format or to put in words\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*forms* - grammar forms as in imaginary `INumbered` in the snippet above
