# Naming in software design

The naming of libraries, packages (assemblies), classes, methods, and even non-public _vars_ must be a **â„–1** challenge and better involve the whole team<sup>:family:</sup> in discussions. This expense will pay off with *lingua franca* throughout the team and project, and ...

+ common comprehension of a domain, collaboration, and indeed bound team,
+ genuine design and self-descriptive code,
+ inspiration for behavior/domain-driven design,
+ escape from heaps of reqs, specs, DoU, and meetings protocols - hard to follow but easy to misunderstand or forget (but mostly neglected),
+ reduced efforts to get into a project for newcomers,
+ comfy navigation within the source code (with an IDE's explorer or <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd>).

## Rules of thumb

The higher the level of naming, the more attention.

## Verbal sins

- **Grandiloquence** 

Even top developers under time pressure and brakes on perfectionism will name logic classes as *services*, *helpers*, *utils*, *handlers* but would 
be barely proud of that.

General words will sound vague if not bombastic unless established in the domain. Compare florid `[Fact]` to modest `[TestCase]`. 

PUBLIC UTILITY

- **Jargonism**

### Guidelines for methods

`Get` must be taboo within method names - either this must be property or a better description of the returned: `Read`, `Calculate` u.a.

### Hall of shame

And 1st place goes to ... `dirty` used as the property of a modified object may hold the 1st place.
