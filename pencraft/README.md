## Comments in code

Self-descriptive, clean codes need no comments, otherwise this signalizes flaws, foremost poor naming.\

Theré're projects, products and technologies, which merit creative work of pen. They must inspire readers to use those and are often choice factor Nr 1.

The worst enimies of pencraft are formalism, wordiness, lack of feedback.

Pencraft is harder than development. One shall start, provided...
