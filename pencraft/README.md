# Techical writing

## Comments in code

Self-descriptive, clean codes need no comments, otherwise this signalizes flaws, foremost poor naming.\
However comments are fully liable for:

+ bizarre workaround (e.g. for third-party bugs)
+ courtesy of Q&A sites
+ worthy tricks that harm readability
+ snippets in documentation
+ domain-explaining quotes from sources like wiki
