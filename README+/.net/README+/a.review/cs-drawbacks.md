# C# - Drawbacks (minority report)

Art can be perfect, but no technology. With all its goodies __C#__ got downsides as bulky declarations of hierarchies, rigid interfaces, or restrained generics.

The following language artifacts are awkward leastwise for me. 

## Syntax

- Rudimentary `;` ending a line brings nothing but visual noise.
- Constructor names imply extra refactoring on class/struct renaming (could be independent `ctor()`, `this()`). Take the "untitled" `base()` call in the same constructors.
- Rudimentary `0` as the start index in collections<sup>:o:</sup>, which doesn't correlate with the count and shall better start from `1`.
- Missing (default) access modifier<sup>:o:</sup> shall be better reserved for ultimate `private` or better `public` than for specific and less used `internal`
- The `const` modifier shall be not limited to pre-compiled values (it's mere optimization) but prevent re-assignment, as `init` and `readonly` do.
- Nullable declaration (with `?` prefix) is evident for value types but ambiguous for references and objects, which can be nulled anyway:\
`string a = null; string? b = null;`
- Gradual releases of syntax shortcuts, such as `?` or `!`, softly erode C# readability.<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:o:</sup> <sub>These native features can't be changed.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>I assume arguability but hope that C# team doesn't plan to make a Perl out of their language</sub>
  
### Generics

The next definition is terse and clear `class CollWrapper<C, T> where C : ICollection<T> { ... }`, but not the redundancy in its declaration `new CollWrapper<List<int>, int>()`.

Advanced C# design reveals more generic restraints and results in *Vodoo programming* to workaround them.<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>.NET team [admits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/differences-between-cpp-templates-and-csharp-generics)<sup>:link:</sup> that their generics are "_does nots_" of C++ templates.</sub>

## Type system
  
- Root `object`, both non-abstract and interface-less, asserts flaws in object-oriented design. On the other hand, it brings an "original" footprint, big enough to pollute coding space with names.

- Either `class`, `record`, `record class`, `struct`, `record struct`, or *tuples* can declare an entity. Each has pros and cons for a particular case, but deciding between them could distract from design.

- There's no method signature to specify that it must unconditionally throw an exception, and `void` as a return is incorrect.\
(The workaround may be to [declare the return as an exception to be thrown](../b.deduced/cs-hints.md#Gimmicks)).

## Single-class inheritance

A class may refer to only one base class but multiple interfaces with default method implementations. This dismantles arguing for conceptual single-class inheritance (which must have been technically restrained).

However, arranging the code from some interfaces is rather cumbersome and restrictive, and shall be reserved for technical purposes (not multiinheritance design).

Other peculiar and arbitrary alternatives are [extension methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods)<sup>:link:</sup> and dynamic composition (much facilitated with [Roslyn](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jun/07/Runtime-CSharp-Code-Compilation-Revisited-for-Roslyn)<sup>:link:</sup>).

## Namespaces and class organization

* Historic namespaces as [System](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup> are bloated and mixed.
For example, exceptions should be organized in their own namespace with shorter calls: `Exceptions.Argument.Throw(predicate, message="")`.
* Classes like [Math](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>, [MathF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.mathf)<sup>:link:</sup> shall be namespaces for granulated domain classes.

## Casting limitations

- [Named tuples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/august/essential-net-csharp-7-0-tuples-explained)<sup>:link:</sup> and anonymous objects are very handy to submit sporadic composed results, but can't cast to an interface or class.
- Some obvious inheritance is missing (e.g. can't cast `DateTime` to `DateOnly`).
- Neither implicit nor explicit downcasting works while JSON (de)serialization legally does this operation.\
Allowing this cast doesn't contradict type safety.\
ToDo: an example with [contravariance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/generics/covariance-and-contravariance)<sup>:link:</sup>

## Built-in and shipped types

### Numbers
  
- Does either developer ponder ten(!) primitive whole types when writing ordinary `for (var i = 0; i < count; i++)`?
- Summing up 0.1 and 0.2 will reveal a [floating arithmetic flaw](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)<sup>:link:</sup> unless explicitly declared decimal.<sup>ðŸª²</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸª²</sup> You may debug `var roundErr = 0.1 + 0.2;` to prove.

Developers should better declare just a *numeric* and distinguish only the way it's processed: fixed (default) or floating. It would be a great option to derive subclasses from this _numeric_ could (with range and precision constraints).

C#11 introduced [INumber](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.inumber-1)<sup>:link:</sup> which genericizes numbers but in a bulky and restricted fashion.<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>

### String

Laconic `==` implies _ordinal_ _case-sensitive_ comparison while `String.Compare()` is bulky and turbid.
`IndexOf` and other methods with numerous overloads invoke comparison, for which Microsoft advises explicit `Comparison` options.\
Syntax shortcuts here could make the code both shorter and readable.

### DateTime

`DateTime` and `DateOnly` structs are clumsy heritage. They allow to specify exact future dates up to the year 9999, but not for known recorded events before [common era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>.  Year-month-day constructors are ambiguous and allow non-sense `int` values.

## Inborn naming

-  *Interface* is a too common term for contracts (and not only in C#).
- *Reverse*, as in [LINQ method](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.reverse)<sup>:link:</sup>, is actually *flip*.
- Type modifiers _in_/_out_ for contra-/covariance collide with the same name parameter modifiers (_more_/_less_ can be better)

## ðŸš§ TO BE CONTINUED ...

The list is far from being complete and I wait for one day (better to say a decade) when .NET hits a higher note - D-flat or even D#.
