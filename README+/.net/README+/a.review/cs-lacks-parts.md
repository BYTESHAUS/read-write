# C# - Nice to have - Parts and frameworks

Along with [nice-to-have syntax/features](cs-lacks.md) **C#** could grow with some naturally expected parts/frameworks.

## Testing

Tests for drive or coverage are optional but natural share of development. Three most popular frameworks for .NET have their pros and contras but neither is state-of-the-art.

Link to [3D&nbsp;re&#8209;view](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/tree/main/readme+/decisions/testing/test3D) with partial solution.


## Measurement systems

Definition of natural values (geometry, masses, temperature, electricity, movement u.a.) and their conversions between systems of measurements (metric, US customary, UK imperial u.a.) are more than essential tools (e.g., Celsius-Fahrenheit-Kelvin).

Meanwhile, you may try and extend [C# Multifaceted-Value](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/tree/6ab68c7af589d37715c171e61dc51d0b5a208c73/README+/projects/U-Val) to organize units in your applications.


## Lingua
Let's take some output from fictitious tree search `$"Branches: {found}, â‰¥ leaves: {cutoff}"`. That can be quickly refactored for narrative or voice generator:\
`$"{found} {(1 == found ? "branch has" : "branches have")} no less than {cutoff} {(1 == cutoff ? "leaf" : "leaves")}"`

If an application generates much multi-language text it won't be a big deal to implement

```csharp
namespace Lingua.Grammar;

interface INumbered
{
    string Count(long num);
    string Count(double num);
}

interface IPluralForms {
    INumbered Plural((string singular, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Dual((string singular, string dual, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Trial((string singular, string dual, string trial, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Paucal((string singular, string paucal, string plural) forms, string culture = "");
    INumbered Custom(string[] forms, Func<long, int> indexWhole, Func<double, int>? indexFractional = null);
}
```

However
- this reinvents the wheel,
- there are other forms of grammatical numbers besides plurals,
- numbering is only a share of grammatical agreements in every single tongue,
- linguistics goes far beyond competence in a few tongue families.

And what if .NET foundation classes could:
- neatly formulate declensions, conjugation, and other formations,
- define constants for unfamiliar forms of loanwords (greek, Latin u.a.),
- revise habitual [CultureInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup> (classify tongue families and default agreements)

And, not least, add syntax sugar like

<summary><b>Proposal for grammar interpolation</b></summary>
&nbsp;&nbsp;`${number [: [format] : [forms] : []] }`, where

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*number* is whole or fractional subject\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*format* specifies usual format or to put in words\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*forms* - grammar forms as in imaginary `INumbered` in the snippet above
