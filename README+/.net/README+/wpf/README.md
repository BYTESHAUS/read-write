# WPF - Reminder

Despite of much scepsis, justifiable and not, and critics from the very dawn of WPF, it became a fully mature successor of _WinForms_ and a platform of Microsoft products. Unlike its Web companion _manquÃ©_ - Silverlight.

For developers WPF:

+ is the number one platform for Windows clients, which makes a big global market,&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>
+ provides full stack dev without the need to use other platforms and languages,
+ implies [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm)<sup>:link:</sup> and has promoted it to other platforms,
+ renders direct hardware acceleration since Windows&nbsp;7

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup> <sub>The coming Blazor may change the game, but it's not evident now.</sub>
