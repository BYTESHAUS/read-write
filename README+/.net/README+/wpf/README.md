<h1 align="center"><code>WPF</code>.<samp>NET</samp> &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Reminder</h1>

Despite justifiable and not skepticism and hard critics from the very dawn, **WPF** became a fully mature successor of _WinForms_, unlike its Web companion _manqu√©_ <code><b>Silverlight</b></code>, and cross-platform offshoots (like Xamarin).

 **WPF** is the number one platform for Windows desktops with millions of commercial and enterprise applications, released and being developed, enjoying now (2020s) a definite ebb in cross-platform demand.
 
Thus, WPF to .NET/Win is like the Moon to Earth &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; the only natural and permanent satellite. Alternatives are either petit, marginal, exotic, still immature, or already deprecated<sup>üåò</sup>.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>üåò</sup> <sub>You must know about WinForms and may have heard about [Avalonia XPF](https://avaloniaui.net/XPF)<sup>üîó</sup>, Xamarin, WinUI.</sub>

[Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/wpf)<sup>ü™ü</sup> may become the same native unconstrained "bridge" to the browsers and tug a big part of applications, but it's too early to predict in 2025.

### For developers `WPF`:

+ is "native" to Windows (64-bit memory addressing, multitasking, and direct hardware acceleration since _Windows&nbsp;7_),
+ is backed by Microsoft and .NET devoted experts, concerned with its stability and progress,
+ implies [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm)<sup>ü™ü</sup> and has promoted it to other platforms,
+ grants <ins>true</ins> **RADD** (Rapid Application Development and Deployment),
+ provides **full stack** dev on .NET (+MS&nbsp;SQL) without the mix of platforms (and involvement of their providers), languages, and tools with differing paradigms<sup>‚òï</sup>.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>‚òï</sup> <samp>Compare to Java, JavaScript/TypeScript stacks with a "botanical garden" of frameworks, libraries, and technologies.</samp>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &thinsp;<samp>When scaffolding and interops may devour a quarter of the programmer's time (and most at the start).</samp>\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>üå≥</sup> <samp>Full stack here means more than the language and platforms &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; one time definition of entities and functions.</samp>

## Rapid Development and Deployment with `WPF`

The learning curve of WPF is distinctly steeper, and the concepts to learn are much broader than those of _WinForms_. 
Nonetheless, a WPF newbie<sup>üî∞</sup> entering either a new or established project has the luck to delay advanced topics till less stressful times. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üî∞</sup> <sup>But experienced in .NET and thinking in MVW<sup>hatever</sup> patterns.</sup>

This includes IDEs/tools, sketching, running, testing, and deployment.

### Initiatives

The best way to learn WPF is to build a basic MVVM application on a green field: proof of concept, prototype, or initial commit. You need a few minutes to start, as in this [sample](README+/mvvm/README.md#sample).

Even better is to take a renowned trial or freeware template, learn it, and build the application on it.

### Large projects

If the application is a grown WPF product, its components will be a huge construction set, pieces of which a novice may soon manipulate with declarative tools. 

For example, take a pro table component from a gallery, declare it in a view, back it with the model data, and adorn it with custom logic in the ViewModel.

And most of these components are already available in miscellaneous suites.

### Deployment

Even if there are no DevOps or dedicated admins, clients can install or update the WPF applications (either as a prototype, test, or release) as easily as unpacking an archived folder. 
A kind of container that will work not only "[on my machine](../../../pencraft/README+/memes/README+/polyptych_works.md)".
