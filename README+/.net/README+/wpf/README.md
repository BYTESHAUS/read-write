# WPF - Reminder

Despite much scepsis, justifiable and not, and critics from the very dawn of **WPF**, it became a fully mature successor of _WinForms_ and a platform of Microsoft's earning products. Unlike its Web companion _manquÃ©_ - Silverlight, and cross-platform offshots (like Xamarin).

Thus, WPF to .NET/Win is like a Moon to Earth - the only natural and long-time satellite.

**WPF** is the number one platform for Windows desktops with millions of enterprise applications released and being developed. Alternative technologies are either marginal, exotic, still immature, or already deprecated<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup> <sub>You may have heard about [Avalonia XPF](https://avaloniaui.net/XPF)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>, Xamarin, WinUI, or [Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/wpf)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup> (the latter may change the dev landscape but it's too early too predict in 2024).</sub>

For developers **WPF**:

+ is "native" to Windows (64-bit memory addressing, multitasking, and direct hardware acceleration since Windows&nbsp;7),
+ is backed by Microsoft and .NET devoted experts, who are concerned with its stability and progress,
+ provides full stack dev on .NET (MS&nbsp;SQL) without the mix of platforms, languages, and tools with differing paradigms<sup>â˜•</sup>,
+ implies [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm)<sup>:link:</sup> and has promoted it to other platforms,
+ and allows **RAD** - true Rapid Application Development, which deserved a subsection below.

### RAD with WPF

WPF is one of the extraordinary environments, which allow both fast dev from scratch and fast entry of technology-newbee :ico:SURE U MUST KNOW C# 

FAST DEPLOY

+ Easily
+ Develop application on a green field: proof of concept, prototypes

The learning curve of WPF is distinctly steeper and the conceptual content is much broader than that of WinForms. Meanwhile WPF but one may not notice it when getting on an established project. EXPLAIN

WPF belongs to rare application development SUB where RAD is NOT AN EMPTY WORD.

+ provides true **RAD**, which also refers to the dev environment/tools, sketching, running, creation of tests, and deployment,
+ and attracts top commercial providers of suites for a professional Look&Feel.

  VERY LOW INTRO LEVEL - BIZ LOGIC !
