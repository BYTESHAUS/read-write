# WPF - Reminder

Despite much scepsis, justifiable and not, and critics from the very dawn of **WPF**, it became a fully mature successor of _WinForms_ and a platform of Microsoft's earning products. Unlike its Web companion _manquÃ©_ - Silverlight.

**WPF** is the number one platform for Windows desktops with millions of enterprise applications released and being developed. Alternative technologies are either marginal, exotic, still immature or already deprecated<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup> <sub>You may have heard about [Avalonia XPF](https://avaloniaui.net/XPF)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>, Xamarin, WinUI, or [Blazor](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/wpf)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup> (the latter may change the game but it's too early too judge in 2024).</sub>

For developers **WPF**:

+ is "native" to Windows (64-bit memory addressing, multitasking, and direct hardware acceleration since Windows&nbsp;7),
+ is backed by Microsoft and .NET devoted experts, which are beneficiaries of its stability and progress,
+ provides full stack dev on .NET (MS&nbsp;SQL) without the mix of platforms and languages with differing paradigms<sup>â˜•</sup>,
+ implies [MVVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm)<sup>:link:</sup> and has promoted it to other platforms,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>â˜•</sup> <sub>Compare to Java/Javascript/Typescript stacks with disputes on frontend framework and backend DB.</sub>
