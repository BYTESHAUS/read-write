# MVVM and WPF

Model-View-ViewModel (abbr. MVVM) is a well-accepted, easy, powerful concept of __separation of concerns__, also known as [MVP](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html).

WinForms application can be an exemplary MVVM<sup>:wrench:</sup> but it was WPF that formed a symbiosis with MVVM and made the latter mainstream (and not only in WPF). Notably successful and stable Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2010 was written from scratch in WPF relying on MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:wrench:</sup>&nbsp;<sub>In fact WPF is based on Winform's [Binding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.binding)</sub>

## Structure

|- __Model__  - usual [application model](../../../dev/design/readme+/software-parts/app-model.md)\
|- [__ViewModel__](readme+/wpf_mvvm-viewmodel.md)\
|- __View__ - usual [application view](../../../dev/design/readme+/software-parts/app-view.md) bound to ViewModel\
|--- [XAML view](../readme+/wpf-xaml_view.md)

## Sample

An MVVM application may grow into an enterprise solution, but from the ground up its sketch claims a mere few minutes&nbsp;<sup>:arrow_down:</sup>

## Drawbacks and lacks

Let's stress once again that MVVM is not a template but a concept. It got  WPF implementations from Microsoft (e.g. Prism), other big names, communities, and private initiatives but neither has achieved the status of industry-standard as UI suites.

Alas, there are not too many popular pluggable "bricks" to build custom WPF-MVVM, and there's no thesis on dynamic MVP resting on tasks - not static models.

## Wrapping up

MVVM has been widely established but is neither a golden nor universal section. On call of peculiarity or creativity any other, even monolithic, form is legal.&nbsp;<sup>:triangular_ruler:</sup>
