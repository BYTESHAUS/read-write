<h1 align="center">Heavily biased about <code>C#</code></h1>

This premier **.NET** language deserves to be noted as one of the most eloquent and all-around languages/platforms for systems and applications. 
It's a dedicated Microsoft flagship<sup>⛵</sup>, where the ship is <sub>[![.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-512BD4?logo=dotnet&logoColor=fff)](#)</sub> and the flag is <sub>[![C#](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/C%23-%23239120.svg?logo=cshrp&logoColor=white)](#)</sub>.

It evolves nonstop, providing us with state-of-the-art, concise, comprehensible syntax, and incredible features ([LINQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321724/where-can-i-get-a-good-concise-linq-cheatsheet)<sup>🔗</sup>, [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl)<sup>🪟</sup>, [Rx.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive)<sup>:octocat:</sup> i.a.). 

Its dedicated team<sup>:people_holding_hands:</sup> learns from the drawbacks and advantages of other languages, own [community](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/proposals)<sup>:octocat:</sup>, and looks up trade-offs between readability and brevity.

**`C#`** allows developers to focus on [code quality](../software/QA/README+/code-quality.md), which .NET will care to compile into effective and safe executables.<sup>💾</sup>  The cleaner the code, the better the performance.<sup>🪩</sup>

Nonetheless, **`C#`** offers "lower-level" _unsafe_ syntax, optimized collections, concurrent structures, and memory spans for specific boosts, intensive tasks, and parallel calculations.

Besides new features, each annual release improves the performance of significant parts. Learning resources are best-of-the-breed for newcomers and skilled with IDEs, free for educational and personal use.<sup>⌨️</sup>

Amazingly **`C#`** is widely utilized in APIs and drivers to industry-standard **embedded** software (_i.a._ automotive and machinery) and **game dev** (popular [Unity engine](https://unity.com/solutions/programming)<sup>🔗</sup>).

With all the praise given, **`C#`** isn't monumentally accomplished and has its foibles and lacks (my criticisms, wishlists, and ideas are in the subfolders below and near).

## Bottom line

Genuine `C++` or `Perl` experts are legitimate in branding `C#` as "just another _Basic_" while others will argue that it harnesses design fantasies for the sake of dev progress and clarity.
