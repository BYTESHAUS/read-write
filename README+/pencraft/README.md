# Pen & Brush craft&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical writing

<table width="80%" align="center"><tr></tr><tr><td>

[__Documentation__](README+/tech_docu.md)<sup>📄</sup> and [__authoring__](README+/tech-authoring.md)<sup>🖊️</sup> are two very dissimilar employments of writing and painting skills<br />
with opposing values of formalism, creativity, envisaging, and styles.

</td></tr></table>

The principled distinction is __*driven*__ vs __*drives*__:

* <ins>Documentation</ins> is **on-demand/request** derivative of a product or service, must follow templates, and shall be (auto-)generated and reused as much as possible.<sup>📖</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📖</sup> <sub>A strict _User manual_ of hazardous tools is an exemplary story.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/) follows this line but, honestly, this doesn't help to "🪟<b>Learn</b>".</docu>

* <ins>Authoring</ins> is **initiative**, must take a bird's view of the subject, inspire and explain sophisticated and regulated ideas in an abstractive, friendly, and sometimes informal/playful manner.

<ins>**Documentation**</ins> assumes defined, if not available, subjects (as software applications), while <ins>**authoring**</ins> may begin with a pure idea. (Enough technical oeuvres, such as concepts of relational DBs or REST, were based on "paper" concepts with little or no implementation.)

When it's often a reader's headache to find and study the right <ins>documentation</ins> in any state and grade, with <ins>authoring</ins>, it's a burden of "pensters" to attract the public. 

Sticking to the narrowed vocabulary, repetitions, and cliches are benefactors in documentation but authoring sins.

Regardless of mission, significant writing is an expensive and exhausting exercise. If not a hobby or bondage, it must:

+ [x] have a live, eager auditorium,
+ [x] exceed other ways of teaching,\
(consider quickly sketched presentation, captured video tutorial, or even watercooler talks)
+ [x] be long-term (updated and evolved).

## Vital side effects

Documenting/sketching ideas for even small features mitigates the impedance between the stretch of imagination and implementation reality. 

Namely, formalization and structuring compel us to reexplore and examine concepts, enhance good sides, remake the bad, and reject unrealistic or meaningless stuff.

## Appendix. Personal disclaimer

The writings and collections here are ...

* The subject of personal taste, inclination, vision, and fallacies. (It's up to you to look them over or recoil in distaste.)
* The subject of continuous delivery (i.e. endless edit and modification).
* Some opuses may be in the badly readable state of 🚧draft🐝 (skip them while I do my best to finish).
