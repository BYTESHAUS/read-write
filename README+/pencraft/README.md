# Pen & brush craft - Technical writing

__Documentation__ and __authoring__ are two diverging employments of writing and painting skills with opposed values of formalism, creativity, imagination, and styles. Their principled distinction is __*driven*__ vs __*drives*__:

* Documentation is **on-demand/request** derivative of a product, must follow templates, and shall be (auto-)generated and reused as much as possible.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>A strict _User manual_ of hazardous tools is an exemplary story.</sub>

* Authoring is **initiative**, must take a bird view of the subject, inspire and explain sophisticated and regulated ideas in abstractive friendly, and sometimes informal, fashion.\
(Much of the renowned works, such as relational DBs or REST, were based on "paper" concepts with little or no implementation.)

Regardless of missions, any tech writing is an expensive and exhausting exercise and, if not a hobby or bondage, must:

+ [x] have a live eager auditorium,
+ [x] excel other ways of teaching (consider quickly sketched presentation, captured video tutorial, watercooler talks),
+ [x] be long-term (updated and evolved).

Now, time to split:\
|- [Documentation](README+/tech_docu.md)\
|- [Authoring](README+/tech-authoring.md)\
|- Technical illustration ðŸš§ // will be written when I finally master the pen tablet

Other uses of pen&brush, you may enjoy (or recoil in distaste):\
|- [Freestyle essays](README+/essays/)\
|- [Collecting IT quotes](README+/quotes)\
|- [IT Memes](README+/memes)

And how without going [offtopic](README+/offtopic)?

## DISCLAIMER

* The subject of personal tastes, inclination, vision, and fallacies. It's up to you whether to read/like them or not.
* The subject of continuous work and rework
* Some works are in the state of ðŸš§draftðŸš§
