# Pen & brush craft - Technical writing

[__Documentation__](README+/tech_docu.md)<sup>üìÑ</sup> and [__authoring__](README+/tech-authoring.md)<sup>üñäÔ∏è</sup> are two very diverging employments of writing and painting skills with opposed values of formalism, creativity, imagination, and styles. Their principled distinction is __*driven*__ vs __*drives*__:

* <ins>Documentation</ins> is **on-demand/request** derivative of a product, must follow templates, and shall be (auto-)generated and reused as much as possible.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>A strict _User manual_ of hazardous tools is an exemplary story.</sub>

* <ins>Authoring</ins> is **initiative**, must take a bird's view of the subject, inspire and explain sophisticated and regulated ideas in an abstractive, friendly, and sometimes informal/playful, manner.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>

<ins>Doumentation</ins> assumes defined, if not available, subjects (as software applications), while <ins>autoring</ins> may begin with a bare idea.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>Much of the renowned works, such as relational DBs or REST, were based on "paper" concepts with little or no implementation.</sub>

When it's a reader's headache to find and study the right <ins>documentation</ins>, with <ins>authoring</ins>, it's a burden of "pensters" to attract readers. 
In documenting sticking to the narrowed vocabulary and cliches is a benefactor, in authoring the repetition is a failure.

Regardless of missions, any tech writing is an expensive and exhausting exercise and, if not a hobby or bondage, must:

+ [x] have a live eager auditorium,
+ [x] excel other ways of teaching (consider quickly sketched presentation, captured video tutorial, watercooler talks),
+ [x] be long-term (updated and evolved).

## Disclaimer

The writings and collections here are ...

* The subject of personal taste, inclination, vision, and fallacies. It's up to you whether to like them or recoil in distaste.
* The subject of endless editing and rework.
* Some opuses may be in the badly readable state of üößdraftüöß (now skip them).
