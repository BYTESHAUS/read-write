# Technical writing

__Documentation__ and __authoring__ are two differing employments of writing skills with opposed values of formalism, creativity, imagination, and styles. Their principled distinction is __*driven*__ vs __*drives*__:

* Documentation is **on-demand/request** derivative of a product, must follow templates, and shall be (auto-)generated as much as possible.\
(A strict _User manual_ of hazardous tools is an exemplary case.)

* Authoring is **initiative**, must take a bird view of the subject, inspire and explain sophisticated and regulated ideas in abstractive friendly, and sometimes informal, fashion.\
(Much of the renowned works, as about REST, were based on concepts with little public implementation.)

Regardless of missions, any tech writing is an expensive and exhausting exercise and thus must:

+ [x] have a live auditorium,
+ [x] excel other ways of teaching (consider quickly sketched presentation, captured video tutorial, watercooler talks),
+ [x] be long-term (updated and evolved).
