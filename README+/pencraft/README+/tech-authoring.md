# Technical authoring

[Best author advice]</p>

Certain software products, and technologies deserve the work of a pen or brush. The rank of such work may be a decision factor Nr&nbsp;1 for the usage of/funding for its subject: either attract or divert for good.

Technical authoring lies between documentation and literature and must have an artistic feel, rich vocabulary, and allure of the latter in frames of technical topics.

For technically bright heads, freestyle authoring may seem deceptively easygoing: 

* Tongue is the only tool sharpened in use.
* Creative opus won't produce compilation errors.
* Illustration is what everybody already learned in childhood.
* Tech authors shall not much invent themes and plots for the writing.
  
<span title="&nbsp;What You See Is What You Write"><ins>WYSIWYG</ins></span> of the opus and rapidity of writing can create square miles of 'pulp'. 
However, noble lines of words are much more sophisticated and painful than excellent code. And a smart reader will notice poor or mediocre style from the very first sight.

The 2020s decade of LLM-generated content has visibly raised the bar for good words and pictures.

## Tips

Internet swarms with advice, hints, and guidelines for writing - useful, practical - but which you could formulate yourself. May I add up a few?

### Lectures/Courses

Listening to any lecture (live or recorded), course, or discussion can rescue you from stagnation. It forces you to accept other points of view and urges you to contend and generate your arguments mentally.

> It's not an invitation to plagiarism - just the opposite. You may find that an idea is already covered, and put it to a source reference.

### Library

  <p>For less or more creative activity in both code and word, going to a library, picking engaging off-topic books (better nicely illustrated), looking through them, and returning to the writing can be a real booster.</p>
  <p>Thus occasional rummaging and leafing through <i>Electronic Engineering</i> inspired me with <a href="https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/blob/main/README%2B/techniques/README%2B/circuitry/README.md#why-circuitry">circuitry</a> technique.</p>
  <p>Randomly opened mathematical books helped me to polish the <a href="essays/README+/SW_architect-aTake.md">Architect(ure)</a>. (Yes, this essay could be worse.)</p>

## Pitfalls

The worst enemies of authorship are:

- repetitions (words, phrases and cliches),
- monotonous volume (wordiness),
- formalism,
- indifference.
