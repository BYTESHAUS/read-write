[Best author advice]</p>

Some projects, products, and technologies deserve the work of a pen or brush. The rank of such work may be a decision factor Nr&nbsp;1 for the usage of/funding for its subject: either attract or divert for good.

Technical authoring lies between documentation and literature and must have an artistic feel, rich vocabulary, and allure of the latter in frames of technical topics.

For technically smart heads freestyle authoring may seem deceptively easygoing: 

* Tongue is the only tool sharpened in use.
* Creative work won't produce compilation errors.
* Illustration is what one learns in early childhood.
* You shall not invent themes of the work.
  
<span title="&nbsp;What You See Is What You Get"><ins>WYSIWYG</ins></span> of the work and rapidity of writing can create square miles of 'pulp'. However noble lines of words are much more sophisticated and painful than excellent code. And a smart reader will notice poor or mediocre style from the very first sight.

In the decade of LLM-generated content criteria for the good word and syllable are getting stricter.
