Long after their decline the punching technology and its carton carrier still remained a coursework at my university. 

Till the supply of cards became extinct &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; I caught the last year of this legacy.
                        
## The Task
      
It was an exercise in PL/I&nbsp;<sup>🔢</sup> &mdash; output a curve of an assigned function (a variant of $`ax^2 + bx + c`$ was mine). And the <i>output</i> meant <b>direct to the line printer</b> using teletype symbols for <samp>X/Y</samp> axes and the graph.

Believe it or not, this story had no electronic display.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🔢</sup>&nbsp;<samp>IBM's procedural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I">Programming Language One</a><sup><b>w</b></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code><b>PL/1</b>, <b>DB2</b>, <b>OS/2</b>, <b>Type-III</b>, <b>BS12</b>,</code> ... this Blue Giant was a lord of imagination and naming.</samp>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:cinema:</sup> <samp>Fun fact: traces of PL/1 appear in the epic <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/2001-a-space-odyssey-predicted-the-future50-years-ago">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>.</samp>

## Carton in, paper out

The moves the task took were hardly agile even for its time:

&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1️)</b> Come up with a _programme_ and sketch it in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2️)</b> Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements.<sup>🥪</sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3️)</b> Submit this papyrus to the punching shop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where good ladies were used to decypher student scribble.<sup>🛠️</sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 _one day after_ ⛅ ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4️)</b>&nbsp;&thinsp;Fetch a deck of punched paperboard (~inch thick).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>5)</b> Bring it to the _computing center_<sup>🏛️</sup> where the mystery will occur.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 <i>one/two days after</i> ⛅ ...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>6)</b> Pick the medieval scroll in the "print" department.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>7)</b>  Search for a graph among collateral outputs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If fail, read errors, debug (mentally), and go to <b>(2)</b>.

The motivation was so strong (as you might feel) that many succeeded in the first approach, but not me.

Between **(4)** and **(5)** a fellow disciple intruded: shuffling my deck unnoticed. Instead of the graph, I got bad (machine) language printed and a lesson learned about data integrity and security.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🥪</sup> <sub>I wonder how it may look object-oriented. A card glued over the base one to inherit or override&thinsp;?</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🛠️</sup> <sub>Precisionists can definitely treat their occupation as true absolute coders.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🏛️</sup> <sub>One who saw mainframes would advocate the name for this huge open space hall with metal cabinets.</sub>

<h1 align="right">Extramural afterword</h1>

This mediocre story is a chance to remind the reader of the outstanding traits of this medium, &mdash; 
despite its fast decadence predetermined by data density (it couldn't get either mini/micro or double side next).

I venture to propose punch cards as a backup if computer illiteracy ages come<sup>📚</sup> or for extraterrestrial spam<sup>🚀</sup>. And that's why:

+ Easy to make: neither rare minerals nor precious elements involved, and the process is as dumb as for papier-mâché.
+ The cards will be intact for millennia in harsh environments.\
Any mechanical action, dirt, temperature, or humidity, that can damage them, will irreparably sweep other media.  A cheap safe box will rescue them from direct fire and chemical agents.
+ Electromagnetic emission in the whole spectrum can't bring even a tiny data loss.\
It's not about household magnets, short circuits, and solar flares. Punch cards will survive nuclear disasters and [gamma-ray bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst)<sup><b>w</b></sup>.
+ They have a look&feel of data storage, easy to read<sup>🪢</sup> manually or with DIY device.
+ Eco-friendly and highly utilizable. 
Even if the data remains unclaimed or safely copied, our heirs or other species may use the cards as our ancestors: bookmarks, pads, or fans.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📚</sup> <sub>As it happened with the Writing in centuries before Homer.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🚀</sup> <sub>A deck of punchcards could make a better impression than naive [Pioneer plaques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque) 
and volatile mundane [phonograph records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record)<sup><b>w</b></sup>.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🪢</sup> <sub>Though there was a joke that IBM's positioning of holes won the US government bid for encryption.</sub>
