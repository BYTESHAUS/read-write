As a developer of Lotus Notes<br/>LOB applications for over a decade<br/>(before switching to .NET),<br/>I must have deserved the privilege<br/>of personal (Lotus) notes.

Corporate IBM PC users remember (or not) that it was a time and a <b>word</b> &mdash; not Microsoft's one or WordPerfect, but <mark>"Lotus"</mark>, a synonym for spreadsheet, text processor, calendar, E-Mail client, and collaboration tools.

The multiplatform groupware _Lotus Notes_ (henceforth also _LN_), released at the turn of 1991, joined the best of computer sciences from the 1980s with _laissez-faire_ IT in the 1990s and rapidly became the system of core value for companies and teams. 

LN paved the public road to diverse innovations: client-server, multirole/group authorization, doc-oriented DB<sup>📜</sup>, __**replication**__<sup>⭐</sup>, to name a few of the unique goodies.

Devs and admins will remember genuine Rapid Application Development with fluent installation/evaluation<sup>🙋</sup>.

There were similar suites - legacy, alternative, or tailor-made - but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden ... until Microsoft began to win its large chunks of office software.

In 1995, IBM gained Lotus in full<sup>💰</sup>. It was a big chance not only to gain from internal use and sales but also to reform at least _LN_ with the influence, know-how, and technologies of the Big Blue. 
However mediocre and inaccurately focused efforts caused Lotus to wilt.<sup>🍦</sup>

In 2001 Microsoft delivered a much more complex and bulkier competitor - **SharePoint**. 
Nevertheless, it presented the next software generation as a product and API and gradually superseded _LN_ in one-way traffic, being deprived of the inherent vices of the Lotus pioneer. 

The bargain sale of Domino/Notes and donating office source code to freeware put the _full stop_ of the story. From this time on _LN_ paced to a legacy on the IT margins.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📜</sup> <sub>Long before NoSQL became mainstream.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>⭐</sup> <sub>Emphasized for rare ease, versatility, productivity, and robustness. 
Besides synchronizing DBs it allowed to seamlessly use/develop LN offline, guarantee messaging, and merge design much simpler than in Git or TFS.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>I can't imagine a newbie installing SharePoint on a notebook and writing the first useful application within a week.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>💰</sup> <sub>For a $3.5 billion - not a big deal nowadays, while made well before IT procurements had skyrocketed at the end of the 1990s.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🍦</sup> <sub>It's not a secret that IBM giving the cold shoulder to Lotus urged many top devs to leave.</sub>

## Postsriptum. Alternative history

Notes had enough outdated and weak sides to surrender to the rival from Redmond (WA), but let's dream up how "survived" LN could look.

+ **Storage as a sound object-relational model over IBM DB2**\
Instead of enclosed and specific Notes Storage Facility (NSF)<sup>💿</sup> 
+ **Single-Page Web-Application as the only user client**<sup>🌩️</sup>\
Akin to Angular or React, eliminating desktop premises and porting _@formula_ language to Javascript utilities
+ **Seamless UI integration of office features**\
Either from Microsoft or those updated from Lotus<sup>🥀</sup>, in popular open formats
+ **Java as main language**<sup>☕</sup>\
As a substitute for rudimentary LotusSciprt; supporting the development of UX libs, shared utils, and dev env extensions.
+ **Better learning resources**\
  The difference between IBM's "search for" and Microsoft's "select from" was too obvious. 

**Last but not least**, top pro and liable  _Notes_ team/community to fulfill this wishlist and prevent quality degradation<sup>🙋</sup>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>💿</sup> <sub>E.g. NSF didn't support _foreign keys_, thus requiring "amateurish" boilerplate for any docs relations (as hierarchy). There was a plan to put DB2 under LN (like MS SQL behind Sharepoint), but that was never realized.</sub> \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🌩️</sup> <sub>Though Notes Server could render applications on HTTP since 1996, designing forms required pretty much fine-tuning with HTML/JS. XPages since R8.5 came too late and were half-response.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🥀</sup> <sub>1-2-3 and Word Pro were already outmoded in 2000.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>☕</sup> <sub>LN supported development in Java but its version always lagged and required knowledge of specific workarounds (like calling garbage collector in a cycle of LN docs). There was peculiar C++ API as well, however, most developers _nolens volens_ used dated LotusScript - a branch of Visual Basic with built-in LN API.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>"Migrating" myself from LN to .NET, I experienced, for certain: beta versions of Visual Studio 2010 crashed less often than the release of Notes Designer.</sub>

> Let me finish with the quote from another hit - _Now I know what made Lotus blue_. In earnest, I was pretty sure that _Lotus_ until [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_I_Know_What_Made_Otis_Blue). This tells enough about my involvement.
