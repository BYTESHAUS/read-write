# Lotus Notes - "This used to be my playground"

<table><tr><td width="35%">
<p>The multiplatform groupware <code>Lotus Notes</code><sup><mark>LN</mark></sup>, released at the turn of 1991, joined the best of computer sciences from the 1980s with <i>laissez-faire</i> IT in the 1990s and rapidly became the system of core value for companies and teams.</p>

IBM PC users remember (or not) that it was a time and a <b>word</b> &mdash; not Microsoft's one or WordPerfect, but «<b>LOTUS</b>», a synonym for spreadsheet, text processor, calendar, E-Mail client, and collaboration tools.\
Developers and sysadmins will remember genuine Rapid Application Development with fluent installation/evaluation<sup>🙋</sup>.

LN paved the public road to diverse innovations: client-server, multirole/group authorization, doc-oriented DB<sup>📜</sup>, __**replication**__<sup>⭐</sup>, pictograms in view columns &mdash; 
to name a few of the extraordinary goodies.

There were similar suites - legacy, alternative, or tailor-made - but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden ... until Microsoft began to win its large chunks of office software.

* In 1995, <sub>[![IBM Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/IBM-052FAD?logo=ibm&logoColor=fff&style=for-the-badge)](#)</sub> gained Lotus in full<sup>💰</sup>.\
It was a big chance not only to gain from sales and internal installations but also to reform at least _LN_ with the influence, know-how, and technologies of the Big Blue. 
However mediocre and inaccurately focused efforts caused Lotus to wilt.<sup>🍦</sup>

* In 2001 Microsoft released its "bird of a feather" - **SharePoint** - much more sophisticated and bulkier but promoting the next generation (as a product and API).\
SharePoint was deprived of many inherent vices of the Lotus pioneer and began to gradually supersede _LN_ in the one-way migration. 

* The bargain sale of Domino/Notes and donating the office's source code to freeware paved the way for _LN_ to legacy on IT margins.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📜</sup> <sub>Long before NoSQL became mainstream.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>⭐</sup> <sub>Emphasized for rare ease, versatility, productivity, and robustness. 
Besides synchronizing DBs it allowed to seamlessly use/develop LN offline, guarantee messaging, and merge design much simpler than in Git or TFS.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>I can't feature a newbie installing SharePoint on a notebook and writing the first useful application within a week.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>💰</sup> <sub>For a $3.5 billion - not a big deal nowadays, while made well before the 2000s when IT procurements had skyrocketed.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🍦</sup> <sub>It's not a top secret that IBM's cold shoulder urged many top Lotus engineers to leave.</sub>

## Postsriptum. Alternative history

Notes had enough outdated and weak sides to surrender to the rival from Redmond (WA), but let's dream up how "survived" LN could look.

+ **Storage as a sound object-relational model over IBM DB2**\
Instead of enclosed and specific Notes Storage Facility (NSF)<sup>💿</sup> 
+ **Single-Page Web-Application as the only user client**<sup>🌩️</sup>\
Akin to Angular or React, eliminating desktop premises and porting _@formula_ language to Javascript utilities
+ **Seamless UI integration of office features**\
Either from Microsoft or those updated from Lotus<sup>🥀</sup>, in popular open formats
+ **Java as main language**<sup>☕</sup>\
As a substitute for rudimentary LotusSciprt; supporting the development of UX libs, shared utils, and dev env extensions.
+ **Better learning resources**\
  The difference between IBM's "search for" and Microsoft's "select from" was too obvious. 

**Last but not least**, top pro and liable  _Notes_ team/community to fulfill this wishlist and prevent quality degradation<sup>🙋</sup>.

> <mark>Was it technically doable? <b>Sure</b>.</mark>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>💿</sup> <sub>E.g. NSF didn't support _foreign keys_, thus requiring "amateurish" boilerplate for any docs relations (as hierarchy). There was a never-realized plan to put DB2 under LN (like MS SQL behind Sharepoint).</sub> \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🌩️</sup> <sub>Though Notes Server could render applications on HTTP since 1996, designing forms required pretty much fine-tuning with HTML/JS. XPages since R8.5 came too late and were half-response.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🥀</sup> <sub>1-2-3 and Word Pro were already outmoded in 2000.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>☕</sup> <sub>LN supported development in Java but its version always lagged and required knowledge of specific workarounds (like calling garbage collector in a cycle of LN docs). There was peculiar C++ API as well, however, most developers _nolens volens_ used dated LotusScript - a branch of Visual Basic with built-in LN API.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>"Migrating" myself from LN to .NET, I experienced, for certain: beta versions of Visual Studio 2010 crashed less often than the release of Notes Designer.</sub>\

> Let me finish with the quote from another hit - _Now I know what made Lotus blue_. In earnest, I was pretty sure that _Lotus_ until [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_I_Know_What_Made_Otis_Blue). This tells enough about my involvement.
