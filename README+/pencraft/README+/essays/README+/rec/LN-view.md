#### `Lotus Notes` (henceforth also `LN`), the multiplatform groupware, was first released at the turn of 1991. 

Joining the best of computer sciences from the 1980s with _laissez-faire_ IT in the 1990s, it rapidly became the core asset for companies and teams.

Those who programmed and admined will reminisce about genuine Rapid Application Development with fluent installation/evaluation<sup>🙋</sup> and leading-edge editors.

As a developer of Line-of-Business and corporate applications on Lotus Notes for over a decade<sup><mark>#</mark></sup>, I&nbsp;must have deserved the privilege of personal (Lotus) notes.

**LN** paved the public road to diverse innovations: client-server, multirole/group access, distributed/synchronized doc-oriented DB<sup>📜</sup>, **replication**<sup>⭐</sup>, asymmetric encryption from authorization down to selected fields on demand &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; to name a few hallmarks.

There were similar suites &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; legacy, alternative, or tailor-made &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden ... until Microsoft began to win large chunks of the office software market.

<h2 align="center">Epilogue. Alternate history</h2>

_Lotus Domino/Notes_ had enough outdated and weak facets to surrender to the rival from Redmond (WA), but let's dream up what the "surviving" **LN** would be.

### 💿 Storage as a sound object-relational model over IBM DB2

Notes Storage Facility (NSF) was enclosed and restrained. For example, unavailable foreign keys required "amateurish" boilerplate for document relations (as references or hierarchies). 

There was a never-realized plan to put DB2 under LN storage, akin to MS SQL behind SharePoint. 

### ☕ Replacement of `LotusScript`

Lotus developers _nolens volens_ coded in the out-of-date and too elementary _LotusScript_ &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; a branch of Visual Basic with built-in LN API (resting on `C++` API). 

`Java` could be promoted to a primary language, but its API with a lagging version remained limited, poorly documented, and tricky (e.g., know to call the garbage collector in a cycle of LN docs.).

Even a greater option would be creating an object-oriented flavor of `JavaScript` for both front-end (to replace also `@formula`) and back-end (LN applications weren't exceedingly demanding for performance and semantics).

### 🌩️ Web-browser as the only user client

Although Notes Server could render applications on HTTP since 1996, designing forms required much fine-tuning with HTML/JS. **XPages** (since R8.5) came too late and were half-hearted.

The solution would be to eliminate desktop premises and replace them with a web solution akin to Angular or React. 

### 📎 Seamless UI integration of office parts

_Lotus 1-2-3_ and _Word Pro_ were already outmoded in 2000 (IBM generously paid Microsoft for its _Office_ licenses). LN could integrate better editors/viewers with storage in popular open formats.

### 🏬 Resources

The difference between IBM's "_search for_" and Microsoft's "_select from_" learning materials was notorious. Enough to say.

_Lotus Notes_ wasn't significantly known for things not out-of-the-box, even migrated to [IBM Eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software))<sup><b>W</b></sup>. However, third-party or custom utils, UX elements, and environment extensions must have been its rich part.
 
Great potential for [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)<sup><b>W</b></sup> contributions in Lotus products was never claimed.

### 🙋 Last but not least

This wishlist and quality sustainability would require top and liable teams/community instead of outsourcing. 
("Migrating" myself from LN to .NET, I experienced, for certain, that beta versions of Visual Studio&nbsp;2010 were less eager to crash than sametime releases of Notes Designer.)

<h2 align="center">⬆️ <mark>Was it technically doable? &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; <b>Absolutely</b> ⚫</mark></h2>

> Let me finish with the quote from another single: "_**Now I know what made Lotus blue**_."\
> (Yes, I know &mdash; **_Otis_** but, in earnest, I was pretty sure that _Lotus_ until [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_I_Know_What_Made_Otis_Blue)<sup>&thinsp;<b>W</b></sup>. This should suffice to demonstrate my involvement.)
