### `Lotus Notes`<sup><mark>LN</mark></sup>, the multiplatform groupware, was first released at the turn of 1991. Joining the best of computer sciences from the 1980s with _laissez-faire_ IT in the 1990s, it rapidly became the core asset for companies and teams.

As a developer of Line-of-Business and corporate applications on Lotus Notes for over a decade<sup><mark>#</mark></sup>, I&nbsp;must have deserved the privilege of personal (Lotus) notes.

Developers and admins will reminisce genuine Rapid Application Development with fluent installation/evaluation<sup>🙋</sup> and leading-edge editors.

LN paved the public road to diverse innovations: client-server, multirole/group access, distributed/synchronized doc-oriented DB<sup>📜</sup>, **replication**<sup>⭐</sup>, asymmetric encryption from authorization down to selected fields on demand &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; to name a few of the extraordinary goodies.

There were similar suites &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; legacy, alternative, or tailor-made &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; but this aquatic flower dominated the market garden ... until Microsoft began to win large chunks of the office software market.

* In 1995, <samp><sub>[![IBM Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/IBM-052FAD?logo=ibm&logoColor=fff&style=for-the-badge)](#)</sub> gained Lotus in full<sup>💰</sup></samp>.\
It was a big chance not only to gain from sales and internal installations, but also to reform at least _LN_ by leaning on the influence and technological capital of Big Blue.\
However, mediocre and inaccurately focused efforts caused Lotus to wilt.<sup>🍦</sup>

* In 2001, Microsoft released its "bird of a feather" &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; **SharePoint** &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; much more sophisticated and bulkier but promoting the next generation of a product and API.\
SharePoint was deprived of many inherent vices of the Lotus pioneer and gradually began to supersede _LN_ in the one-way migration. 

* The bargain sale of Domino/Notes and donating the office's source code to freeware pushed out _LN_ to IT margins.

&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>📜</sup> <samp>Long before NoSQL became mainstream.</samp>\
&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>⭐</sup> <samp>Emphasized for rare ease, versatility, productivity, and robustness. Besides synchronizing DBs it allowed us to seamlessly use/develop LN offline, guarantee messaging, and merge design much simpler than in Git or TFS.</samp>\
&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>💰</sup> <samp>For a $3.5 billion - not a big deal nowadays, while made well before the 2000s when IT procurements had skyrocketed.</samp>\

## Postsriptum. Alternative history

Notes had enough outdated and weak facets to surrender to the rival from Redmond (WA), but let's dream up how "surviving" LN could look.

+ **Storage as a sound object-relational model over IBM DB2**\
Instead of an enclosed and specific Notes Storage Facility (NSF)<sup>💿</sup> 
+ **Single-Page Web-Application as the only user client**<sup>🌩️</sup>\
Akin to Angular or React, eliminating desktop premises and porting _@formula_ language to JavaScript utilities
+ **Seamless UI integration of office features**\
Either from Microsoft or those updated from Lotus<sup>🥀</sup>, in popular open formats
+ **`C++`or`Java` as a main language**<sup>☕</sup>\
Actual version as a substitute for too elementary LotusScript
+ **Better learning resources**\
  The difference between IBM's "search for" and Microsoft's "select from" was too obvious.
+ **Libraries of UX elements and utils, dev environment extensions**\
 Lotus Notes could be on the wave of Open Source

**Last but not least**, top pro and liable  _Notes_ team/community to fulfill this wishlist and prevent quality degradation<sup>🙋</sup>.

&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>💿</sup> <sub> E.g.. NSF didn't support _foreign keys_, thus requiring "amateurish" boilerplate for any docs relations (as hierarchy). There was a never-realized plan to put DB2 under LN (like MS SQL behind Sharepoint).</sub> \
&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>🌩️</sup> <sub>Though Notes Server could render applications on HTTP since 1996, designing forms required pretty much fine-tuning with HTML/JS.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **XPages** since R8.5 came too late and were half-response.</sub>\
&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>🥀</sup> <sub>1-2-3 and Word Pro were already outmoded in 2000.</sub>\
&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>☕</sup> <sub>LN supported development in Java, but its version always lagged and required knowledge of specific workarounds (like calling the garbage collector in a cycle of LN docs).\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most developers _nolens volens_ used dated LotusScript only - a branch of Visual Basic with built-in LN API (with C++ API behind).</sub>\
&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>🙋</sup> <sub>"Migrating" myself from LN to .NET, I experienced, for certain: beta versions of Visual Studio 2010 crashed less often than the release of Notes Designer.</sub>\

This must tell enough about my involvement.
