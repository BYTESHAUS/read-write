ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§           DRAFT / PLACEHOLDER ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Don't let the hype eclipse the apparent: IT is decades in the **natural** stagnation.

 (link to mobile among steampunk)

Most future predictions are cringe and facepalm


No chg since 1980s (1950 - 1980 - 2025): PC, IDE, OOP, patterns, 

3D, SWasTest (no, no, not what you thought - users test - u use, u test), Tasks orientation (will replace model)

Another level of 


MORE DYNAMIC, MORE DECLARATIVE

			Scaling mobile screen to BIG (no more mobile)



OS ?
Embedded ?
Assistants ?

## Epilogue. Why stagnation

The same desktop, mouse, keyboard and the same IDE.

OOP,
