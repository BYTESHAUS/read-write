# Driving Tests &mdash; Big Watershed

I was bicycling to hear a casual lecture on __TD<mark>D</mark>__ and the doubt crept in &mdash; where am I going:

  </td><td>
     <b>"</b>Must this <mark><b>D</b></mark> be for <b><i>Design</i></b> or <b><i>Development</i></b>❓<b>"</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't about the lecture, but the principal divergence.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>For the record: the lecture regarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development<sup>🔗</sup>">Test Driven <b>Development</b></a> as you night have already expected.</sub>
</td></tr></table>

Worried I retrospected popular TDD tutorials and revealed that the shadow of doubt was from the ridge dividing _dev_ and _design_. 
What's did matter worse (I had to rewrite much of my stuff) - it was one on the landscape among others mountain chaings with the peaks named "domain", "design", "drives", and "tests". I've exploited this theme in DRIVES but here I'd like to share the thought...

DRIVE LINKE

But let's not get sidetracked for now, and scheme this watershed.

MAY INTERCEPT BUT DIVERT !

> SPOILER❗**Write-first test coverage shall not drive design while design tests shall not cover functionality to develop.**\
<sub>This simple revelation struck me at a lecture on TDD when I realized that the last D is not for **D**esign but **D**evelopment.</sub>

> A software system can best be designed if the testing is interlaced with the designing instead of being used after the design.\
