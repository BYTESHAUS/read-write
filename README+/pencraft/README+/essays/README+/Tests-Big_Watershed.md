# Big Watershed of Test Drives

I was bicycling to hear a casual lecture on [TD<mark>D</mark>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)<sup>🔗</sup> and doubt crept in &mdash; where am I going: «Is that <mark><b>D</b></mark> not for _Design_ but _Development_?». It wasn't about the lecture but the principal divergence.

Worried I retrospected popular TDD tutrials and revealed that the shadow of doubt was from THE MOUNTING RIDGE dividing dev and design. What's next - it was one among others with the peaks named "domain", "design", "drives", and "tests". I've exploited this theme in DRIVES but here I'd like to share the thought...

> SPOILER❗**Write-first test coverage shall not drive design while design tests shall not cover functionality to develop.**\
<sub>This simple revelation struck me at a lecture on TDD when I realized that the last D is not for **D**esign but **D**evelopment.</sub>
