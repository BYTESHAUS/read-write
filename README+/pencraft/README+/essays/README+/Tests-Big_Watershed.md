Pretty worried I retrospected popular TDD tutorials and revealed that the shadow of doubt was from the ridge dividing _dev_ and _design_. While dev was mainstream understanding - some even didn't bother much and used both terms interchangeable.

What did matters worse (I had to rewrite much of my stuff) - it was one on the landscape among others mountain chains with the peaks named "domain", "design", "drives", and "tests". I've exploited this theme in DRIVES but here I'd like to share the thought...

DRIVE LINKE

But let's not get sidetracked for now, and scheme this watershed.

MAY INTERCEPT BUT DIVERT !

> SPOILER❗**Write-first test coverage shall not drive design while design tests shall not cover functionality to develop.**\
<sub>This simple revelation struck me at a lecture on TDD when I realized that the last D is not for **D**esign but **D**evelopment.</sub>

> A software system can best be designed if the testing is interlaced with the designing instead of being used after the design.\
