  </td><td><p>I was bicycling to hear a casual lecture on <b>TD<mark>D</mark></b> and the doubt crept in &mdash; where am I going: </p>
    <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must this <mark><b>D</b></mark> be for <b><i>Design</i></b> or <b><i>Development</i></b>❓</p>
It wasn't about the lecture, but the principal divergence.<br />
(For the record: the lecture regarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a><sup>🔗</sup> as you might been convinced.)

Pretty worried I searched by <kbd>T D D</kbd> and fairly retrospected the found. Presentations and lectures favored _development_ with design as a **natural** derivative, not much bothering about distinction and some even exploited both terms interchangeably. Books and tutorials also inclined more toward techniques, patterns, and testing frameworks.

What was fine and **natural** for presentations, bootcamps, and `classes` didn't work for me on just mediocre features (imaginary or tried): <ins>my test drive split up into **D**esign and **D**evelopment</ins>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Albeit being energetic in the recherche I couldn't go through the best part of treatises. There must be the same findings, but better, and there could be better alternating visions.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🌵</sup> <sub>**Natural** since any complete snippet can't escape design or must fit into the given.</sub>

## Could I explain my shismatic take?

These could be the same project and team, test tools/framework, and skills/techniques to write tests, but...

> **Design vs. Development are too dissimilar and exclusive to be driven together.** "Design tests" define **what** to implement: test-driven or not. 

There's no compromise: Design through implementation tests will result in a narrowed "Code Driven Design", which quality will degrade with complexity.


+ grope concepts and get a hands-on feeling on subjects (be it bookkeeping routines or starship models),
+ vitalize skeleton functionality, evaluate trends and risks,
+ couple design fantasies with the tech-stack materiality.


HIT IDEA 
WHAT INTERCEPT's DOES NOT OVERLAP. WHAT COOPERATES do not DEPENDs

Tests for DESIGN couple syntax possibilities and constraints

## Conclusion

MOVE DOWN to CONCT
What made matters worse &mdash; revealing that this ridge is among others on the design topology. This triggered the painful rewrite of much stuff, starting from ⚙️[drives](../../../../software/design/drive) **but** let's not get sidetracked for now.
