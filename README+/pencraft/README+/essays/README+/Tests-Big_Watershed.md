  </td><td><p>I was bicycling to hear a casual lecture on <b>TD<mark>D</mark></b> and the doubt crept in &mdash; where am I going: </p>
    <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must this <mark><b>D</b></mark> be for <b><i>Design</i></b> or <b><i>Development</i></b>❓</p>
It wasn't about the lecture, but the principal divergence.<br />
(For the record: the lecture regarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven <b>Development</b></a><sup>🔗</sup> as the abbreviation itself.)
</td></tr></table>

Deabbreviation alone didn't settle my doubts, I searched by <kbd>T D D</kbd> and fairly retrospected the found.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Albeit being energetic in the recherche I couldn't go through the best part of treatises. There must be the same findings, but better, and there could be better alternating visions.</sub>

Presentations and lectures favored _development_ with design as a natural<sup>🌵</sup> derivative, not much bothering about distinction and some even exploited both terms interchangeably. Books and tutorials also inclined more toward techniques, patterns, and testing frameworks.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🌵</sup> <sub>**Natural** since any complete snippet can't escape design or must fit into the given.</sub>

What was fine for presentations, bootcamps, and `classes` didn't work for me on just mediocre features (imaginary or tried): <ins>my test drive now split up into **D**esign and **D**evelopment</ins>.

## Could I draw <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my shismatic take?

### Test Driven Design: T⚙️D<sup>eV</sup>

Think of tests as a superb conductor (proxy) of design drive - domain, behavior, data, hardware model, whatsoever - to... 

+ grope concepts and get a hands-on feeling on subjects (all the same: bookkeeping artifacts or particle collider models),
+ vitalize skeleton functionality, evaluate trends and risks,
+ couple design fantasies with the tech-stack materiality,
+ evaluate and pick more suited libraries, frameworks, and, in some cases, languages/platforms,
+ discuss ideas, naming, and logic with consultants and users.

> "Design tests" must define **what** to develop</ins>. 

These tests and the code behind them must heavily apply doubles (mocks, dummies, stubs) and ugly but fast implementation shortcuts (not to be buried in implementation). When procs get fixed contours and stabilize - these doubles are ready tasks for development: test-driven or not.

### Test Driven Development: T⚙️D<sup>eS</sup>

Use of the test double must be limited to indispensable (stubbing a remote service or unavailable data) and diagnose helpers (as spies).

### OVERLAP ?

There's no room for compromise: implementation-first will result in an abstraction-poor _Code Driven Design_, which quality will degrade with complexity.

WHAT INTERCEPT's DOES NOT OVERLAP. WHAT COOPERATES do not DEPENDs


## Conclusion

What made matters worse &mdash; revealing that this ridge is among others on the design topology. This triggered the painful rewrite of much stuff, starting from ⚙️[drives](../../../../software/design/drive) **but** let's not get sidetracked for now.

SUBRIDGE

> These could be the same project and team, test tools/framework, and skills/techniques to write tests, but...\
>  **Design vs. Development are too dissimilar and contradictory to be driven together.**
