# Tests, Design, Development - Coverage and Drives - Big Watershed of Tests

I was bicycling to a casual lecture on [TD<mark>D</mark>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)<sup>🔗</sup> and a doubt crept in: «Is <mark><b>D</b></mark> not for _Design_ but _Development_?». It wasn't about the lecture but the principal divergence.

Further review of popular TDD stuff revealed that the shadow of doubt was from oncoming clouds of misconceptions and text refactoring.

> SPOILER❗**Write-first test coverage shall not drive design while design tests shall not cover functionality to develop.**\
<sub>This simple revelation struck me at a lecture on TDD when I realized that the last D is not for **D**esign but **D**evelopment.</sub>
