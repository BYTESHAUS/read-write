  </td><td><p>I was bicycling to hear a casual lecture on <b>TD<mark>D</mark></b> and the doubt crept in &mdash; where am I going: </p>
    <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must this <mark><b>D</b></mark> be for <b><i>Design</i></b> or <b><i>Development</i></b>❓</p>
It wasn't about the lecture, but the principal divergence.<br />
(For the record: the lecture regarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a><sup>🔗</sup> as you might been assured)

Pretty worried I searched with "<samp><b>T&nbsp;D&nbsp;D</b></samp>" and retrospected fairly many tutorials and lectures found.<sup>🙋</sup> They focused on _development_ with design as a **natural**<sup>🌵</sup> derivative, not much bothering about distinction and some even exploited both terms interchangeably. Big and short books techniques, patterns, and testing frameworks.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Albeit being energetic in the recherche I couldn't go through the best part of treatises. There must be the same findings, but better, and could be better alternating visions.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🌵</sup> <sub>Natural since any running piece of code implies design will unless available)</sub>

What was fine and **natural**<sup>🌵</sup> for presentations, bootcamps, and `classes` didn't work for me quite on features (imaginary or tried). This shadow of doubt was from the rising ridge, dividing syntax and implementation behind it.

What made matters worse - revealing that this ridge is among others on the design topology triggered the painful rewrite of much stuff, starting from ⚙️[drives](../../../../software/design/drive) **but** let's not get sidetracked for now.

WHAT INTERCEPT's DOES NOT OVERLAP. WHAT COOPERATES do not DEPENDs

Tests for DESIGN couple syntax possibilities and constraints
