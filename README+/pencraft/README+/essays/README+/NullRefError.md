**‚àÖ`NULL`‚ö°REFERENCE earned a gruesome reputation as an _exceptional_ plague.** 

Its outbreaks appear literally from `nothing` and are too common to call them just `exceptions` &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; 
they strike in safe and unmanaged code, in the bolted-to-the-floor mainframes and in clouds, and spare neither junior nor seasoned developers.

_Turing_ awardee [Sir&nbsp;Tony&nbsp;Hoare](../../quotes/README+/contributors/README.md#tony-hoare) voluntarily took the blame of being this _Frankenstein_ who brought the 
[**billion&#8209;dollar&nbsp;mistake**](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/)<sup>üé•</sup> into the software Eden. 

And no one else _Great_ can cut this sinister _Gordian_ "blockchain" to stop  collecting its billion toll.\
\___________\
<samp>**BEWARE**</samp>**!** `Null` may be disguised as `Nothing`, `nil`, `none`, `undef[ined]`, or even `NaN`. And `Reference` may be `Pointer`, `dereferencing`, or none (just "null").

### The fallacy of equivocation 

<sup>üé•</sup>&nbsp; If you can't couple the 1950s subscripts **and** today's exceptions &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; you are **not** alone (and probably in a good company).

`Null` is a logical consensus to designate not initialized values. There's no specific `boolean` or machine value for it. 
The error occurs chiefly when we, developers, forget to initialize &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; that's what C# [null reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullreferenceexception) tells:

> * **You forgot to instantiate a reference type.**
> * **You forgot to dimension an array before initializing it.**
> * **You get a null return value from a method, and then call a method on the returned type**\
> ... and so on.

There's no null or broken reference, which sends our objects and values to nowhere. That's our fault.

Null reference isn't a CPU (or memory) vulnerability as [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability))<sup><b>w</b></sup> that no software patch can fix.

It's not even comparable to the Y2K problem, which stemmed from explicit negligence (and was eliminated with an obvious and simple date format enhancement).

Logical errors of different origins caused botched global updates, blackouts, and catastrophic failures, when exception names play a secondary role. 

Another specific type multiplied and spread many disasters &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; and it is no sign of exception or error.

When a number of software installations is significant, providers continuously collect reports on errors, which crash their products, get handled, or run undercover (unnoticed).

Their statistics give `NullReference` the first place (from my experience too). Many of these errors are difficult to trace, reproduce, and debug. 
Those not regular and critical may stay for years with the lowest priority for investigation.

Time and size populate projects' closets with ghost `NullReference` errors &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; the syndrome of the design decadence, which often gets symptomatic treatment.

<h2 align="center">The Mistake&thinsp;?</h2>

<p align="right">Accusing <code>null</code> for errors is like <br />charging <mark>&thinsp;<b>0</b>&thinsp;</mark> for one can divide by it.</b></p>

### `Null` is not a bug but a feature

First, `Null` is not a popped transistor, phantom, bug, stub, rudiment, or singularity. It's not more than a logical placeholder for unassigned variables and the initial and valid state of objects. 
When neglected, it sincerely warns about a breach.

Besides plain cases, `NullReference` may be the visible summit of the iceberg made of logical faults. 

It's a rather strange idea that there could be a programming language without `null`. Meanwhile, mainstream languages allow nullable numeric types to avoid the unwanted default to zero.

### Blaming the messenger

Errors in delivered software are annoying since **_1)_** [it worked on my machine](../../memes/README+/polyptych_works.md), and **_2)_** they could be a headache to debug. No wonder `NullReference` got a magnified dislove.

The bad approach is that ignoring or silencing may cure the problem (though sometimes it works, for a while).

### "Scapegoating" (‚â† Goatscaping) 

When the source of a problem isn't evident, it's a time to explain it with the order of planets, air from bogs, bad demeanor, or faults of others. 

It's tempting to relate the perplexed cases of `NullReference` to the peculiarities and bugs of the underlying platforms.

(Based on <a href="#null-case">true stories</a>.<sup title="Read one in bottom lines">üôã</sup>)

<p dir="rtl">,<b><code>Null</code></b> is for programming<br />as <code><b>zero</b></code> for mathematics</p>

## Foam &rarr; Apply theory</samp>

**Math**, as the mother of all sciences, is believed to solve all their problems. Ironically, it has no concept of _null_ to aid its firsthand employment, leaving us alone with this problem.

Null isn't a specific value (it may be memory 0), but a predefined constant. Quite convenient, though some programmes look at it as <span title="&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arab mathematicians brought&#013; 0Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp;to Europe from India only&#010; in the Middle Ages."><ins>Phygaros</ins></span> at zero.

I wouldn't like to classify _null_ traps by managed/unmanaged, pointer vs. reference vs index, but break them into three **BE**s:

* **CAN'T** BE &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; the assignee (field, variable, or object) can **never** be null.\
And only a peculiar glitch allowed setting it. E.g., objects coming from builders.
* **SHAN'T** BE &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; the assignee can take _null_ but not now or here.\
E.g., a booking request can be _null_ when returned or cancelled, but not when submitted to the invoice routine.
* **MUST** BE &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; Surpsisinly opposite? The value must be null there, but either falsely stubbed or set to a default.\
_Enums_ (enumerations), i.e., declarative numbers, are rather prone to such errors.

## Rinse &rarr; <samp>Back to keyboard</samo>

First and foremost, there is no magic wand to eliminate `NullReference` errors, as clickbait titles often try to suggest. And there shall be none.

Besides sound logic, [quality code](../../../../software/QA/README+/code-quality.md) and apparent measures (including language aid), the following practices must prevent unexpected exceptions:

### Do not hide

Relying on default or _pro forma_ values instead of `null` obviously paves the way to epic fails. 

### Every null check must be sane

<table><tr></tr><tr valign="center"><td>‚òùÔ∏è</td><td>

If a check allows _null_ to propagate or replaces it with a value,\
‚úÖ it must be deliberately for the logic &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;\
‚ùå not to avoid further exceptions or IDE warnings.
   
</td></tr></table>


In the 2020s decade, mainstream languages tempt you to chain null checks: ```Book?.Author?.Name?.Middle is null or ""```

Here, a lucid proof of the optional name builds a multi-level shelter for bugs.

### Guards

Be the first to throw.

### Do not treat as empty&thinsp;/&thinsp;zero

```if (fridge.IsNullOrEmpty) order(ice);``` // there could be no fridge and the ice will melt

Inspired by C# `string.IsNullOrWhitespace(..)`.

### Reduce direct declarations

Avoid declaration, but use Builders/Factories/Wizards.

### Utilize language protection

When possible, use attributes or constraints that a language provides. It won't prevent complex logical errors, but foolproof the code. 

### Distinguish

JavaScript has a native `undefined`. In other languages, a never set value may throw a specific exception, like in this tailored property [`AbsYear`](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/blob/main/src/TuttiFrutti/AbcChrono/Timescales/Models/Hap.cs).

Bad approach: setting a specific object that will only mask `null` to make matters worse.

## <a id="null-case" />Bottom lines

<sup>üôã</sup> I find personal stories the last shelter of narrators unless it's a full match and a good backup. This must be the case.

>  I can remember a contractor for a big, really, enterprise who was assigned a sporadic **NPE** (null pointer exception) in a tailored application. 
After sacrificing a couple of hours, he addressed this pesky _null_ to the dark forces of [Lotus Notes](LN-view.md) and returned to his daily need &mdash; [N&thinsp;f&thinsp;S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed)<sup><b>w</b></sup>.
>
> For the team's sake, a peer developer picked this ticket to dive into the hand-obfuscated code. After making the brain function on all cylinders, the slices of Swiss cheese coincided to reveal a malicious an<i>null</i>er. To be trivially fixed.
> <div align="center"><b>MORAL</b>‚ùì</div>
> Imagining the multitude of such cases without a happy twist, <i>Sir Hoare</i> may surely write off a digit or two from the tech debt he shouldered.
