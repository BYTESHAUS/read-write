<p>The essence of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect anything more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches. Some ancient Greeks were so good at it that observers coined "<i>architect</i>"<sup>🏛️</sup> - the term romanized to <i>architecture</i> only centuries later.</p>
<p>Then ages passed till the art of immobile acknowledged and methodized architects as a detached trade &mdash; 
refined craftsmen exempt from routines and narrow-profile burdens to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.</p>

## Software vs. Building - much in common...

The architecture of both demands creativity and grants enough room for phantasy and missteps but must deliver functional wholes quickly rather than ripen aesthetic values. Projects in both often begin from sketching on white paper or board.

Both take advantage of the flexible plethora of tools, techniques, and skills. Both must accumulate mainstream and alternate practices and reveal patterns.

Imperfect abstraction work and planning can make both a mess which products loudly crash. Both can abused for hollow promises and sandcastles.

Both can't rely solely on generations of experience and a single mastermind but on a team (with a hierarchy or not) of pundits.

 <td><p>Buildings are static, conservative, and traditional &mdash; software is fluid, experimental, knowing no nostalgia, and with no place for neoclassicism.</p>
 <p>Constructions are embossed with materials (and their costs), locations &mdash; software abstracts from pure boolean logic (without relay, transistor, or warm lamp vibes). However, software systems propagate the "philosophy" of a selected stack (languages/frameworks, storage, servers, communication protocols, ...) and imports.</p>
  <p>Software is the most automated production where copying, scaling, installation, and updates are clickable. Decades, min for wood cabins, set records in mainframe software, which won't recur (till interstellar flights).</p>

Software development gives freedom of life-sized _trial and **error**_ unthinkable in other productions. Builders may only envy sustainability and seamless upgrades/swaps of hardware basements and communications (utilities). On the contrary, drawing plans months ahead of some code is adverse to software.

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a phenomenon, but not as an exercise. Contrary to the building DIRECTIVE it <ins>disperses the classical figure of the architect</ins> allowing **everybody** and **efficiently** to zoom IN technological details and zoom OUT to concepts (up to top architecture). 

> This doesn't assume parity. The bigger the team, the bigger the offset of its members to coding or design according to preferences and talents with or without roles exchange.

**But wait ...** Reputable software providers hire/promote architects, who are the central figures at many IT events. There's certification after all.

First and above all, *software architect* sounds cool and distinguishes one from crowds of senior developers<sup>🙋</sup>, impressing managers, customers, and stakeholders.

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;It's often an alias for roles and duties:&nbsp;</inst> ➡️</summary>

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, propagating portfolio of verified solutions to new applications,
* _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "*librarian-navigator*", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
* geeks from _computer science_.
 
</details>

⬅️ Let alone DevOps, as a separate subject in software.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋🙋</sup> <sub>The tops of C#.NET are titled architects or leads but all of them show strong coding skills at presentations.</sub>

## Conclusion

There was no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bundle of avant practices with strong practical backup. This makes up the architecture &mdash; a synergy of collective and best vision, design, and development.

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects aren't _Pantheon_ but the routine adaptation of requirements to known and tried solutions with quite a decent input of cutting-edge ideas.
