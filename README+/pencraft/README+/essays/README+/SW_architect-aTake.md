# Architecture and Architect

The spirit of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that being great observers they coined the term _architect_<sup>🏛️</sup> centuries before it was romanized to _architecture_.

Then it took ages till the art of immobile methodized and acknowledged architects as a detached trade &mdash; 
refined craftsmen exempt from routines and narrow-profile burdens to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.

Much later diverse spheres (from mega-vessels and supercomputers to less determinate economics and politics) loaned «architecture» to figuratively underline systematic complicacy. However, <span title="Microarchitecture of hardware systems"><ins><code><b>μ</b>arch</ins></code></span> hasn't fostered micro-architects (giga- either), while architects of détente or *economic miracle* is a compliment.

## Software vs. Building

The architecture of construction and software have much in common. Both demand creativity, and provide huge room for phantasy but must deliver functional wholes in a short period rather than aesthetic values. Both rely on a dynamic plethora of tools, techniques, and skills. Both must accumulate practices and reveal patterns.

Lack of proficient abstraction work and planning can make both a mess that will eventually crash loudly. Both can be grounds for hollow promises and sandcastles.

**Diversities are larger...**

Constructions are static &mdash; software is fluid. If <b>«</b>architecture is frozen music»<sup>🎼</sup>, the software is "unleashed symphonic cacophony circus tent]"<sup>🐦‍⬛</sup>.

Ends up in MATERIALS vs. ABSTRACTION which ends up in abstraction (don't NEED even considering LAMP vs. TRANSISTOR, ssd vs vinchester). SOFTWARE HAS NOT LIMITs (take mining farms) COMPARE TO BURJ HALIF or NEOM !

The software gives freedom of FULL-SCALE experiment unthinkable in other spheres.

The lifecycle of construction is much longer. 

YOU CAN't ACCEPT a BUILD that may crash (no stage).

### Construction architect vs. software

## Hypothesis

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. 

**Let me explain such a take.**  There's no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices with practical backup.

This said the software is least suitable for pure architects. 

IF NO_CODE THEN ELSE_IF CODE THEN

A determined person or board in high-pro fixed teams may rely on communication BUT ...

### Dissonance

 Reputable software manufacturers hire _architects_, and they are the central figures at many IT events, there's certification after all.
The team of C#.NET, which is the cnterfold of my dev, speaks about architects....

First and above all, *software architect* sounds cool and distinguishes one from the crowd of developers<sup></sup>. Not that  than _mastermind_, and more serious than _dev lord_, that it means. FOR CLIENTS its

<sub>Much profanated DEVeloper where everybody is senior</sub>

Then the title expresses a path of enlightenment of one unchained from the keyboard to draw beautiful top diagrams freed of the digging within dusty codes. 

It's often an alias for roles and duties:

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, extrapolating known solutions to other adaptations,
* _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "*librarian-navigator*", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
* geeks from _computer science_.

### :construction: Jack of all trades

HOW OFTEN TO BE ON THE SPOT?

Building is multifaceted but domains of SW even more.

## Conclusion

Architecture and design are synergies of 

Architecture artifacts rest on collective development.


## Wrap up. Does it matter?

Not at all. Titles are like book covers. You don't care about it when getting to the contents.

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects are CASTING domain concepts to known and tried architectural solutions with decent contributions. Many arch and design solutions are already solved in languages and platforms.
