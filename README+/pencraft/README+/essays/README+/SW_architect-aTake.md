## Part&nbsp;I. Software vs. Building 

### much in common...

The architecture of both demands creativity and grants leeway and vast playland for phantasy and missteps, but functional wholes must be defined quickly rather than ripen aesthetic values. Endeavors in both often begin from sketching on white paper or board.

Both take advantage of the flexible plethora of tools, techniques, and skills. Both must accumulate mainstream and alternate practices and reveal patterns.

Imperfect abstraction work and planning can make both a mess which products loudly crash. Abuse of both for hollow promises and sandcastles is more frequent than in other industries.

Both can't rely solely on generations of experience and picked masterminds but on a team of professionals and pundits (with a hierarchy or not).

 <p>Buildings are static, conservative, and traditional &mdash; software is fluid, experimental, reflecting little nostalgia, and with no place for neoclassicism.</p>
 <p>Constructions are embossed with materials (and their costs), locations &mdash; software abstracts from pure boolean logic (without relay, transistor, or warm lamp vibes). However, software systems propagate the "philosophy" of a selected stack (languages/frameworks/libraries, storage, servers, communication protocols, ...).</p>
  <p>Software doesn't rust or erode but gets obsolete in a few years. Decades (pure minimum for wood cabins) set records in residual mainframe software, which won't recur (till interstellar flights).</p>

Software development gives freedom of life-sized _trial and **error**_ unthinkable in other productions. Builders may only envy sustainability and seamless upgrades/swaps of hardware basements and communications (utilities). 

Contrariwise, months of upfront planning and prototyping are adverse to software, which paces in releases and favors [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)<sup><b>w</b></sup> ASAP.

Software is the most automated production where copying, scaling, installation, and updates are one-click (or few, or scheduled) and unattended.

## Part&nbsp;II. Finding _ᾰ̓ρχῐ_-coder

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a phenomenon, but not as an exercise.

Contrary to the building experience programming <ins>disperses the classical figure of the architect</ins> allowing and demanding from **everybody** to **efficiently** <mark>zoom IN</mark> implementation details and <mark>zoom OUT</mark> concepts (up to top architecture).<sup>🔎</sup>

> **This assumes neither parity nor full inside of each technology and methodology.**&#8287;
> The bigger the project, the bigger the vertical↕️ and horizontal↔️ and offsets of team members according to skills, talents, experience, and preferences with or without roles exchange.\
> &nbsp;
> ( ↕️ between coding and design; ↔️ within the technologies stack) 

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;"Architect" is often an alias or umbrella term for good known roles and duties:&nbsp;</ins> ➡️</summary>

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, propagating portfolio of verified solutions to new applications,
* _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "*librarian-navigator*", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the design and code,
* geeks from _computer science_.
 
</details>

⬅️ Let alone DevOps, as a separate area in software.

This makes up the software architecture &mdash; a synergy of collective and best vision, design, and development from multiple points. Gaps in connecting design to code will create the insulation layer of misconstruing and block potentials.

## but hold on...

**Reputable software providers hire/promote architects; they are central figures at IT events. There's certification after all.**

Above all, *software architect* sounds cool, distinguishes one from crowds of senior developers<sup>🙋</sup><sup>👩‍👦‍👦</sup>, and impresses managers, customers, and stakeholders.&#8287;
Neither _expert_, _Chief Programming Officer_ nor _dev&nbsp;lord_ could match.

> There was no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bundle of avant practices with strong practical backup. 

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that major software isn't _Pantheon_ but the routine adaptation of requirements to known and tried solutions with quite a decent input of cutting-edge ideas.
