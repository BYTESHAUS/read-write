# Finding Software Architect

<p dir=rtl><mark>"<b>.I am the Architect</b>"</mark><br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>fictitious character of)<br/>(<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. 

**Let me explain such a take.** (This was not to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices.)

1. OTHER STRONG VIEWS EXIST
2. both DESIGN and ARC

## Genesis

The spirit of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that they coined the term _architect_<sup>🏛️</sup> centuries before Romans latinized *architecture* from it.

Then it took ages till the immobile art of construction methodolized and acknowledged architects as a detached trade. That means refined craftsmen, exempt from narrow-profile routines and headaches to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.

Later MISC spheres loaned *architecture* mostly as a metaphor to underline the system complicacy. From mega-vessels and supercomputers down to less determinate economics and politics. However, **μ**arch hasn't fostered microarchitects, while architects of détente or *economic miracle* are sooner for a compliment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🏛️</sup> <sub>Greek: ἀρχιτέκτων, “master/chief builder/maker" but this occupation must have existed much prior as the Pyramids suggest.</sub>

## Software as Building 

Architecture/DESIGN? of constructions and software have much in common. Both must yield functional products rather than aesthetic values.

Both must accumulate practices and reveal patterns.

Without solid asbtraction work, both end up as a disastrous BABYLON TOWER that sooner or later will loudly crash.

Diversities are larger...

### Software != Building

Software is fluid compared to static structures. The thinker who noticed: "Architecture is frozen music"<sup>🎼</sup>, would see software as "unleashed symphonic cacophony [under the circus tent]".
NAME OF ORCHE RAZYGRYV-e

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🎼</sup> <sub>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), missattributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full original quote: _Architektur ist gefrorene Musik. (Möge es immer beschwingt und harmonisch zugehen in diesem Haus!)_</sub>

The lifecycle of construction is much longer. 

YOU CAN't ACCEPT a BUILD that may crash (no stage).

Architecture results in masterpiece buildings and indistinctive typical constructions. The latter isn't for IT, where even tailoring the existing software isn't development.
 
 MUST BRING from  the aesthetic value to ART. NO Pantheon.

### Hypothesis

This said the software is least suitable for pure architects. 

IF NO_CODE THEN ELSE_IF CODE THEN

A determined person or board in high-pro fixed teams may rely on communication BUT ...


### Dissonance

Reputable software manufacturers hire _architects_, and they are the central figures at many IT events, there's certification after all.

First and above all, *software architect* sounds cool. Not that  than _mastermind_, and more serious than _dev lord_, that it means.

Then the title expresses a path of enlightenment of one unchained from the keyboard to draw beautiful top diagrams freed of the digging within dusty codes. 

It's often an alias for roles and duties:

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "*librarian-navigator*", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
* geeks from _computer science_.

### :construction: Jack of all trades

HOW OFTEN TO BE ON THE SPOT?

* static vs dynamic
* versatile vs strict

Building is multifaceted but domains of SW even more.

## Wrap up

Architecture and design are synergies of 

Architecture artifacts rest on collective development.

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects are application of known architectural solutions with decent contributions. Many arch and design solutions are already solved in languages and platforms.
