<h1 align="right">Part&nbsp;I. Software <i>vs.</i> Building</h1>

### much in common...

The architecture of both demands creativity and grants leeway and vast playland for phantasy and missteps, but operating wholes must be defined quickly rather than ripen aesthetic values. Endeavors in both often begin from sketching on white paper or chalkboards.

Both take advantage of the flexible plethora of tools, techniques, and skills. Both must accumulate mainstream and alternate practices and reveal patterns.

Imperfect abstraction and planning can make both a mess which products loudly crash. Abuse of both for hollow promises and sandcastles is more frequent than in other industries.

Both can't rely solely on generations of experience and picked masterminds but on a team of professionals and pundits (with a hierarchy or not).

 <p>Buildings are static, conservative, and traditional &mdash; software is fluid, experimental, and free of nostalgia (as neoclassicism on Danube).</p>
 <p>Constructions are embossed with materials (and their costs), locations &mdash; software abstracts from pure boolean logic (without relay, transistor, or warm lamp vibes). However, software systems propagate the "philosophy" of a selected stack (languages/frameworks/libraries, storage, servers, communication protocols, ...).</p>
  <p>Software doesn't rust or erode but gets obsolete in a few years. Decades (bare minimum for wood cabins) set records in residual mainframe software, which won't recur (till interstellar flights).</p>

Software development gives freedom of life-sized _trial and **error**_ unthinkable in other productions. Builders may only envy sustainability and seamless upgrades/swaps of hardware basements and communications (utilities). 

Contrariwise, months of upfront planning and prototyping are adverse to software, which paces in releases and favors [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)<sup><b>w</b></sup> ASAP.

Software is the most automated production where copying, scaling, installation, and updates are one-click (or few, or scheduled) and unattended.

* _consultant_, propagating portfolio of verified solutions to new applications,

⬅️ Let alone DevOps, as a separate area in software.

This makes up the software architecture &mdash; a synergy of collective and best vision, design, and development from multiple points. Gaps in connecting design to code will create the insulation layer of misconstruing and block potentials.

## but hold on...

**Reputable software providers hire/promote architects; they are central figures at IT events. There's certification after all.**

Above all, **_software architect_** sounds cool, distinguishes one from crowds of senior developers<sup>🙋</sup>, and impresses managers, customers, and stakeholders.&#8287;
Neither <ins>_expert_</ins>, <ins>_Chief Programming Officer_</ins> nor <ins>_dev&nbsp;lord_</ins> can match.

> There was no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bundle of avant practices with strong practical backup.<sup>👩‍👦‍👦</sup>

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that major software isn't _Pantheon_ but the routine adaptation of requirements to known and tried solutions with quite a decent input of cutting-edge ideas.
