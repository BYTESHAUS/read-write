# Architecture and Architects

<p>The essence of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect somewhat more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches - say, megaliths.</p>
<p>Some ancient Hellenes were so good at construction sites that the impressed observers coined "<i>architect</i>"<sup>🏛️</sup> &mdash; the term romanized to <i>architecture</i> centuries later.</p>
<p>Then ages passed till the art of immobile acknowledged and methodized architects as a detached trade &rarr; 
refined craftsmen exempt from chores and narrow-profile burdens to focus on vision, design, blueprints, aesthetics, and their presentation.</p>
<p>Much later diverse spheres (from mega-vessels and supercomputers to less determinate economics and politics) loaned «architecture» to figuratively underline systematic complicacy. 
 Nevertheless, <span title="&nbsp;Microarchitecture of hardware systems"><ins><code><b>μ</b>arch</ins></code></span> hasn't fostered micro-architects (neither nano- nor giga-) and architects of <em>détente</em> or <em>economic miracle</em> are compliments (or flattery).</p>

🏝️ The architecture of both demands creativity and grants **leeway** and vast **playland** for phantasy and missteps, 
but to quickly define operating wholes rather than ripen aesthetic values. 

✏️ Endeavors in both often begin from sketching on white paper or chalkboards.

🎨 Both enjoy the flexibility of many tools, methodologies, and skills.

🔋 Both must accumulate mainstream and alternate practices and reveal patterns.

💥 Imperfect abstraction and planning can make both a mess which products loudly crash.

🎈 Abuse of both for hollow promises and sandcastles is more frequent than in other industries.

👯 Both don't rely solely on generations of experience and picked masterminds but on teams of versatile professionals and pundits (with a hierarchy or not).

 Buildings are <b>immobile</b>, conservative, and traditional &mdash; software is <b>ephemeral</b>, fluid, and free of nostalgia (as neoclassicism).</p>
 <p>Constructions are embossed with materials (and their costs), locations &mdash; software abstracts from pure boolean logic (without relay, transistor, or warm lamp vibes). However, software systems propagate the "philosophy" of a selected stack (languages/frameworks/libraries, storage, servers, communication protocols, ...).
 
 The software doesn't rust or erode but becomes obsolete in a few years. Decades (bare minimum for wood cabins) set lifecycle records in residual mainframe software - unlikely to recur (till interstellar flights).

Software development gives freedom of life-sized _trial and **error**_ unthinkable in other production. Builders may only envy sustainability and seamless upgrades/swaps of hardware basements and communications (libraries/services). 

Contrariwise, months of upfront planning and prototyping are adverse to software, which paces in releases and favors [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)<sup><b>w</b></sup> ASAP.

Software is the most automated production that ever existed when copying, scaling, installation, and updates are one-click (or auto-scheduled) and unattended.

⬅️ ... easy to declare but hard to correspond to alone.

This makes up the software architecture &mdash; a synergy of collective and best vision, design, and development from multiple points. Gaps in connecting design to code will create the insulation layer of misconstruing and block potentials.

## but hold on...

**Reputable software providers hire/promote architects; they are central figures at IT events. There's certification after all.**

Above all, **_software architect_** sounds cool, distinguishes one from crowds of senior developers<sup>🙋</sup>, and impresses hiring managers, customers, and stakeholders.&#8287;
Neither <ins>_expert_</ins>, <ins>_Chief Programming Officer_</ins> nor <ins>_dev&nbsp;lord_</ins> can match it.

> There is no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bundle of avant practices with strong practical backup.<sup>👩‍👦‍👦</sup>

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that major software isn't _Pantheon_ but the routine adaptation of requirements to known and tried solutions with quite a decent input of cutting-edge.
