# Finding Software Architect

<p dir=rtl><mark>"<b>.I am the Architect</b>"</mark><br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>fictitious character of)<br/>(<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. 

**Let me explain such a take.**  There's no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices. Other no weaker opinions also exist.
  
> Here we treat architecture and design together (as everything over the code of particular and imaginary applications/systems) while [![Arc Deco](../../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg)](../../../../software/ArcDeco/) (from which this essay derives) discriminates them as [kin adjacent activities](../../../../software/ArcDeco/README+/03.Stripes).

## Genesis

The spirit of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that they coined the term _architect_<sup>🏛️</sup> centuries before it was romanized to _architecture_.

Then it took ages till the art of immobile methodized and acknowledged architects as a detached trade &mdash; 
refined craftsmen exempt from routines and narrow-profile burdens to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.

Later on, diverse spheres (from mega-vessels and supercomputers down to less determinate economics and politics) loaned «architecture» mostly as a metaphor to underline systematic complicacy. However, **μ**arch hasn't fostered microarchitects, while architects of détente or *economic miracle* are sooner for a compliment.

## Software vs. Building 

The architecture of construction and software has much in common. Both must yield functional products in a short period rather than aesthetic values. Both MISC INSTRUMENTS. Both must accumulate practices and reveal patterns.

Lack of sturdy abstraction work and planning bring both to a mess that sooner or later will loudly crash.

**Diversities are larger...**

Structures are static &mdash; software is fluid. If <b>«</b>architecture is frozen music»<sup>🎼</sup>, the software is "unleashed symphonic cacophony circus tent]", or_ Babylon Tower_ with woodpeckers.

The lifecycle of construction is much longer. 

YOU CAN't ACCEPT a BUILD that may crash (no stage).

Architecture results in masterpiece buildings and indistinctive typical constructions. The latter isn't for IT, where even tailoring the existing software isn't development.

### Hypothesis

This said the software is least suitable for pure architects. 

IF NO_CODE THEN ELSE_IF CODE THEN

A determined person or board in high-pro fixed teams may rely on communication BUT ...


### Dissonance

Reputable software manufacturers hire _architects_, and they are the central figures at many IT events, there's certification after all.

First and above all, *software architect* sounds cool. Not that  than _mastermind_, and more serious than _dev lord_, that it means.

Then the title expresses a path of enlightenment of one unchained from the keyboard to draw beautiful top diagrams freed of the digging within dusty codes. 

It's often an alias for roles and duties:

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "*librarian-navigator*", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
* geeks from _computer science_.

### :construction: Jack of all trades

HOW OFTEN TO BE ON THE SPOT?

* static vs dynamic
* versatile vs strict

Building is multifaceted but domains of SW even more.

## Wrap up

Architecture and design are synergies of 

Architecture artifacts rest on collective development.

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects are CASTING domain concepts to known and tried architectural solutions with decent contributions. Many arch and design solutions are already solved in languages and platforms.
