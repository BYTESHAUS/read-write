<p>The essence of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect anything more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches.

refined craftsmen exempt from routines and narrow-profile burdens to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.</p>

## Software vs. Building - much in common...

The architecture of both demands creativity and grants enough room for phantasy and missteps but must deliver functional wholes quickly rather than ripen aesthetic values.

Both take advantage of the flexible plethora of tools, techniques, and skills. Both must accumulate mainstream and alternate practices and reveal patterns.

Lack of proficient abstraction work and planning can make both a mess which products loudly crash. Both can appear to be grounds for hollow promises and sandcastles.

Both can't rely solely on generations of experience and a single mastermind but on a team (with a hierarchy or not) of experts.

### ...diffs are bigger

<b><code>THEN</code></b>&nbsp;software is a symphonic cacophony<br />
 <sup>🐦‍⬛</sup>.[unleashed under the wandering circus tent]</p>

Buildings are static, conservative, and traditional &mdash; software is fluid, experimental, and with no place for neoclassicism. 

Constructions are embossed with materials &mdash; software abstracts from pure boolean logic (without relay, transistor, or warm lamp vibes). However, the software system is the continuation of ideas of a selected stack (programming languages, storage, servers) and imports.

Software is the most automated production where copying, scaling, and installation are clickable. The lifecycle of construction is much longer while decades are an exclusive case of mainframe programs.

Software development gives freedom of full-scale trial and error unthinkable in other productive areas.

A construction engineer, whose modeling tasks are interlaced with stirring concrete, who is up and there on the spot for master classes in laying bricks and blocks, knows the mechanics of materials as electrics, is licensed to operate excavators and cranes, may inspect constructions for cracks, interviews candidates for carpenters must be a fantastic creature but not in software teams with _Jacks of all trades_.

**Software disperses the classical figure of architects...**

Is that a question? 

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. 

**Let me explain such a take.**  There's no intention to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices with practical backup.

.................... 🚧 :pencil2: 🚧 ... WRITING in PROGRESS ... 🚧 :paintbrush: 🚧 ............................

A determined person or board in high-pro fixed teams may rely on communication BUT ...

THE MATRIX ARCHITECT is the most fictional figure for software.

### Dissonance

Reputable software providers hire _architects_, and they are the central figures at many IT events, there's certification after all.
The team of C#.NET, which is the cnterfold of my dev, speaks about architects....

First and above all, *software architect* sounds cool and distinguishes one from the crowd of developers<sup></sup>. Not that than _mastermind_, and more serious than _dev lord_, that it means. FOR CLIENTS its

<sub>Much profanated DEVeloper where everybody is senior</sub>

Then the title expresses a path of enlightenment of one unchained from the keyboard to draw beautiful top diagrams freed of the digging within dusty codes. 

It's often an alias for roles and duties:

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, extrapolating known solutions to other adaptations,
* _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "*librarian-navigator*", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
* geeks from _computer science_.

## Conclusion

Architecture and design are synergies of 

Architecture artifacts rest on collective development.


And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects are CASTING domain concepts to known and tried architectural solutions with decent contributions. Many arch and design solutions are already solved in languages and platforms.
