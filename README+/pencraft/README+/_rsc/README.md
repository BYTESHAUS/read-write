# Resources - Artistic and other non-code 

Non-code stuff in repositories here contains diverse pictures, snapshots, schemes, quotes, wiki references, and other materials: borrowed (from 3d parties) and own.

## Own resources

Resources, created under this personal profile, such as collages, memes, or texts, contributed by repository owner(s), can be reproduced without asking permission but explicitly referencing the GitHub profile.

## External resources

I have searched for and used works of others for fair and limited use:

* For illustrative and entertaining purposes
* For fun
* Non-commercial

When possible I refer the source or/and attribute to the author.

## Miscellaneous

I couldn't trace sources of certain images/texts (archaeologists say that the source of any can be found in cuneiform.). Some memes are too folk and public to have personal ownership or copyright.

## Conclusion

If you have questions or demands, please contact me by committing to one of the repositories.

Looking forward to hearing from you, yours owner of github.com/Kyriosity (Kyrill D).
