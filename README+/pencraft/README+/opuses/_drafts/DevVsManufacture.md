# Software - Why development couldn't be manufacturing

Busy experienced developers may give a concise answer: _Because it's not._ **Period**.

INFOLDED: if to look for an industry parallel then dev is closer to a constructor bureua or R&D department.

<sub>I've heard once from a customer: *Software is an art*. Pleasing but barely real - there're no galleries of old masters with Algol listings.</sub>

## Rationale

Maybe the story of outsource and success of discounters (as low-cost airlines) is to blame but many producers, managers, investors and customers see development as a routine.

Organize processes, SELECT by skills, plan tasks and hours, and wait planned hours DIV developers * 8/24 * 5/7 = DAYS. Ready
