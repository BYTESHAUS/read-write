# IT quotes - Aged collection

What is a good quote? 
FINE-himorous, WITTY? Fine but not obligatory. 
Clever and consices? Prerequisite.
One that aged good. A must.

That's why here you'll see a definite bias to IT pioneers whose input to the theory **and** practice remained indisputable.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no *obvious* deficiencies.\
&nbsp;\
The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature.


> Without philosophy language design becomes hacking.

_Bjarne Stroustrup_

The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.
Edsger W. Dijkstra (1970)

#METHO

> **Humans are allergic to change**. They love to say, "We've always done it this way."  **I try to fight that.**\
That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.

*Grace Hopper*

## History

### Debugging born

BUG by GRACE HOPPER (HER NAME ALSO DELIVERS!)

### Errors

By June 1949 people had begun to realize that it was not so easy to get programs right as at one time appeared. I well remember when this realization first came on me with full force.
The EDSAC was on the top floor of the building and the tape-punching and editing equipment one floor below. [...] It was on one of my journeys between the EDSAC room and the punching equipment that "hesitating at the angles of stairs" the realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.

Maurice Wilkes

> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.

> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.

REFERRED in MYTH MAN-MONTH

Sounds a bit dense. 

Edsger W. Dijkstra conveyed the idea much BETTER:

> It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with **ten** blunt axes instead.
 (1975, about use of languages)

> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC:\
as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

My opinion is that languages as Basic offer an easy EINSTIEG to newbees and NUBs (i even stated this in my [LN REMINISCENCE](LN-view.md))
