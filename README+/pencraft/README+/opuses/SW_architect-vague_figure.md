In my spoiled and biased opinion, there are no pure _software architects_ while architecture artifacts rest on collective development.

## Rationale

The Latin term "architecture" emerged from the acts of building, and our information epoch spread it over other activities (up to buzzword). 
Hellenes coined the "architect" but it took centuries to distinguish and formalize this profession in the conservative art of static constructions.<sup>🏚️<sup>

* static vs dynamic
* versatile vs strict

Architecture, opposite to design, must be a platform-independent<sup>🎈</sup> abstraction which nevertheless must grow from the practical development.

### Roles falsely granted as the architect

* team/project lead/manager
* lead/senior dev
* librarian
+ computer scientist
+ one who boils down requirements or/and makes sw docu
+ a lucky guy who may draw great diagrams, which are very loose coupled to actual software
