## Intramural experience - short and vintage

It was long after the punch decline and the last year they were legacy coursework at my university. I guess because the supply of this carton product became extinct.

### The Task

It was an exercise in PL/I&nbsp;<sup>🔆</sup> - output a curve of an assigned function (some $`ax^2 + bx + c`$ was mine). And _output_ meant direct to paper using teletype symbols for X/Y axes and the graph. Believe it or not, there was no computer monitor in this story.

### Carton in, paper out

It looks bizarre in this day and age what barely agile steps it took:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**1️⃣** Think over the _programme_ and sketch it in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**2️⃣** Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements. (I wonder how this would be object-oriented.)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**3️⃣** Submit this papyrus to the punching shop - where good ladies were used to decypher student scribble.<sup>🛠️</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 one day after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**4️⃣** Fetch a deck of punched paperboard.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**5️⃣** Bring it to the _computing center_<sup>🏛️</sup> where the mystery will occur.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 one/two days after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**6️⃣** Pick the medieval scroll in the "print" dprt.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**7️⃣**  Search for a graph among collateral outputs.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If fail, read errors, debug (mentally), and go to step&nbsp;(2).

The motivation was so high (as you can see) that most had succeeded in the first approach but not me. Between **4️⃣** and **5️⃣** a fellow disciple intruded: shuffling my deck unnoticed. A lesson learned about data security.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🔆</sup>&nbsp;<sub>[Programming Language One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I)<sup>🔗</sup> - perhaps the best name IBM reserved.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🛠️</sup> <sub>One can definitely treat their occupation as true coders.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🏛️</sup> <sub>One who saw mainframes would advocate the name - huge open space hall with metal cabinets.</sub>

## Afterword

My humble story was only a reminder of this great medium. Despite its fast decadence, the punchcard can be titled the best of all times by a superposition of pros and cons. 

Endurance

Mechanical, electromagnetically

Eco-friendly and highly utilizable. Bookmarks and other domestic uses

Enough crypto to proof of work punch

Mini/micro ? OOP/OOD

Ecology

 resistance (electromagnetic)
