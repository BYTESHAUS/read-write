# Punched card - Once upon a time

I'll not retell the story of [punchards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era)<sup>🔗</sup> but recall in short my short vintage experience.

[BG PIC REQUIRED]

It was long after the punch decline and the last year they were a legacy in coursework at my university<sup>🙋‍♂️</sup>. The task was to output a curve of a specific exponential function: X-Y 2D with teletype symbols.

[DRAWING REQUIRED]\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋‍♂️</sup>&nbsp;<sub>I guess because of the end of the "carton" supply.</sub>

It looks bizarre in this day and age what barely agile steps it took:

**:one:** Think over the _programme_ in [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I)<sup>🔗</sup><sup>🙋‍♂️</sup> and sketch it down in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).\
The fastest and least trouble.

2️⃣ **2️⃣** Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements. (I wonder how this could be object-oriented.)\
➡️ Submit this papyrus to the "input" department - a room where good ladies will punch the cards.\
... 😴 one day after ...\
⬅️ Pick a deck of these cards.\
5. Bring them to the _processing_ dprt.\
... 😴 the day after ...
6. Recieve the medieval scroll of the printout. Listing statements, service info, and curve done with * asterisks and axis with and other typography symbold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋‍♂️</sup>&nbsp;<sub>Arbitrary the best name and acronym for programming language of all times.</sub>
