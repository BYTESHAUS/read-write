# Punched cards - Once upon a time

I'll not retell the story of [punchards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era)<sup>🔗</sup> but recall in short my short vintage experience.

[BG PIC REQUIRED]

It was long after the punch decline and the last year<sup>🙋‍♂️</sup> they were legacy coursework at my university. The task was in **PL/1**<sup>💻</sup> - print a curve of a simple exponential function: X-Y 2D with teletype symbols.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋‍♂️</sup>&nbsp;<sub>I guess because of the end of the "carton" supply.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>💻</sup>&nbsp;<sub>[Programming Language One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I)<sup>🔗</sup> - perhaps the best name and acronym of all time.</sub>

[DRAWING REQUIRED]\

It looks bizarre in this day and age what barely agile steps it took:

1. Think over the _programme_ and sketch it in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).\
The fastest and least trouble. 
2. Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements. (I wonder how this could be object-oriented.)\
3. Submit this papyrus to the "input" department - a room where good ladies will punch the cards.\
... 🌙 one day after ⛅ ... 
4. Pick a deck of the punched cards.
5. Bring them to the computing center (it really deserved the name).\
... 🌙 one day after ⛅ ... 
6. Recieve the medieval scroll of the printout. Listing statements, service info, and curve done with * asterisks and axis with and other typography symbols.
7. If fail, debug (mentally) and go to step&nbsp;(2).

Between steps 3 and 4 a fellow disciple intruded: shuffling my deck unnoticed.

## Footnote. The best storage ?
