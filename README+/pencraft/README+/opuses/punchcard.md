## Intramural experience - short and vintage

It was long after the punch decline and the last year they were legacy coursework at my university. I guess because the supply of this carton product became extinct.

### The task

It was an exercise in PL/I&nbsp;<sup>🔆</sup> - output a curve of an assigned function (some $`ax^2 + bx + c`$ was mine). And the _output_ meant direct to paper using teletype symbols for X/Y axes and the graph. Believe it or not, there was no computer monitor in this story.

### Carton in, paper out

It looks bizarre in this day and age what barely agile steps it took:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**1️⃣** Think over the _programme_ and sketch it in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**2️⃣** Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements. (I wonder how this would be object-oriented.)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**3️⃣** Submit this papyrus to the punching shop - where good ladies were used to decypher student scribble.<sup>🛠️</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 one day after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**4️⃣** Fetch a deck of punched paperboard (~inch thick).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**5️⃣** Bring it to the _computing center_<sup>🏛️</sup> where the mystery will occur.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 one/two days after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**6️⃣** Pick the medieval scroll in the "print" dprt.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**7️⃣**  Search for a graph among collateral outputs.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If fail, read errors, debug (mentally), and go to step&nbsp;(2).

The motivation was so high (as you can feel) that most had succeeded in the first approach but not me. Between **4️⃣** and **5️⃣** a fellow disciple intruded: shuffling my deck unnoticed. A lesson learned about data security.

## Extramural afterword

My humble story is a chance to remind the reader of the remarkable traits of this medium, despite its fast decadence<sup>💾</sup>.

I venture to propose punch cards as a backup if computer illiteracy ages<sup>📚</sup> may come or for extraterrestrial spam<sup>🚀</sup>. 
And that's why.

##### Mechanical

It's quite difficult

Electromagnetic in the whole spectrum

Household magnets proximity, and domestic short-circuit can put HDD/SDD out of order while nearby [ gamma ray bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst)

#### Enough safety

+ Enough crypto to proof of work punch

AND EVEN IF THERE'S NO USE either our heirs or other species
+ Eco-friendly and highly utilizable. Bookmarks and other domestic uses

<sup>🚀</sup> <sub>A deck of punchcards could make a better impression than philistine [Pioneer plaques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque) 
and volatile [phonograph records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record).<sup>🔗</sup></sub>
