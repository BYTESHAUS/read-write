## Intramural experience - short and vintage

It was long after the punch decline and the last year they were legacy coursework at my university. I guess because the supply of this carton product became extinct.

### The Task

It was an exercise in PL/I&nbsp;<sup>1️⃣</sup> - present a curve of an assigned function (some $`ax^2 + bx + c`$ was mine). Using teletype symbols to print 2D X-Y graph.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1️⃣</sup>&nbsp;<sub>[Programming Language One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I)<sup>🔗</sup> - perhaps the best name IBM reserved.</sub>

### Carton in, paper out

It looks bizarre in this day and age what barely agile steps it took:

1. Think over the _programme_ and sketch it in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).
2. Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements. (I wonder how this would be object-oriented.)
3. Submit this papyrus to the punch shop - where good ladies were used to decypher student scribble.\
One can definitely treat their occupation as true coders.\
... 🌙 one day after ⛅ ... 
5. Fetch a deck of punched paperboards.
6. Bring it to the _computing center_ (one who saw mainframes would advocate the name).\
... 🌙 one/two days after ⛅ ... 
7. Pick the medieval scroll in the "print" dprt. 
8. Search for a graph there among collateral outputs.\
If fail, read errors, debug (mentally), and go to step&nbsp;(2).

The motivation was so high (as you can see) that most had succeeded in the first approach but not me. Between (4) and (5) a fellow disciple intruded: shuffling my deck unnoticed. A lesson learned about data security.

## 🚧 Footnote. The best storage ?

🚧DRAFT ,,,

NOW, SERIOUS

Enough crypto [footnote ] to proof of work punch

Domestic use

make them great again ?
Mini/micro ? OOP/OOD

Best media ever by pros and cons: eco, resistance (electromagnetic)
