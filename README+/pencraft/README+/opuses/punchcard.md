## Intramural experience - short and vintage

It was long after the punch decline and they were legacy coursework at my university for the last year - I guess because the supply of this carton product was extinct.

### The task

It was an exercise in PL/I&nbsp;<sup>🔢</sup> - output a curve of an assigned function (some $`ax^2 + bx + c`$ was mine). And the _output_ meant **direct to paper** using teletype symbols for X/Y axes and the graph. Believe it or not, there was no computer monitor in this story.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🔢</sup>&nbsp;<sub>IBM's procedural [Programming Language One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I)<sup>🔗</sup>.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL/1, DB2, OS/2, Type-III, BS12,... - the Blue Giant was also a names' lord.</sub>

### Carton in, paper out

It looks bizarre in this day and age what barely agile steps it took:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**1️⃣** Think over the _programme_ and sketch it in the dedicated notebook (the paper one).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**2️⃣** Fill in a lined paper form with procedural statements.<sup>🥪</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**3️⃣** Submit this papyrus to the punching shop - where good ladies were used to decypher student scribble.<sup>🛠️</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 one day after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**4️⃣** Fetch a deck of punched paperboard (~inch thick).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**5️⃣** Bring it to the _computing center_<sup>🏛️</sup> where the mystery will occur.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;... 🌙 one/two days after ⛅ ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**6️⃣** Pick the medieval scroll in the "print" dprt.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;**7️⃣**  Search for a graph among collateral outputs.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If fail, read errors, debug (mentally), and go to **2️⃣**.

The motivation was so high (as you can feel) that many had succeeded in the first approach but not me. 

Between **4️⃣** and **5️⃣** a fellow disciple intruded: shuffling my deck unnoticed. Instead of the graph, I got bad (machine) language printed and a lesson learned about data integrity and security.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🥪</sup> <sub>I wonder how it may look object-oriented. A card glued over the base one to inherit or override?</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🛠️</sup> <sub>Precisionists can definitely treat their occupation as true pure coders.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🏛️</sup> <sub>One who saw mainframes would advocate the name for this huge open space hall with metal cabinets.</sub>

## Extramural afterword

My mediocre story is a chance to remind the reader of the outstanding traits of this medium, despite its fast decadence<sup>💾</sup>.

I venture to propose punch cards as a backup if computer illiteracy ages<sup>📚</sup> come or for extraterrestrial spam<sup>🚀</sup>. 
And that's why.

+ Easy to make: no rare or precious elements and the techno processes are not harder than for papier-mâché.
+ The cards (especially in the fireproof box) will be intact for millennia in harsh environments.\
Any mechanical action, dirt, temperature, or humidity, that can damage them, will sweep other media.
+ Electromagnetic emission in the whole spectrum can't bring even a tiny data loss.\
It's not about household magnets, short circuits, and solar flares. Punch cards will survive nuclear disasters and [ gamma ray bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst)
+ They have a look&feel of data storage, easy to read<sup>🪢</sup> manually or with DIY device.
+ Eco-friendly and highly utilizable.\
Even if the info remains unclaimed or safely copied, our heirs or other species may use the cards as our ancestors: bookmarks, pads, or fans.

<sup>💾</sup> <sub>Prederemined by data density: there could be no mini and micro, or double side next.</sub>\
<sup>📚</sup> <sub>As it happened with the Writing in centuries before Homer.</sub>\
<sup>🚀</sup> <sub>A deck of punchcards could make a better impression than philistine [Pioneer plaques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque) 
and volatile [phonograph records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record).<sup>🔗</sup></sub>\
<sup>🪢</sup> <sub>Though there was a joke that IBM placing of holes positions won the US government bid for encryption.</sub>
