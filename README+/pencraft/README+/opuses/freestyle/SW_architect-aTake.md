# Software Architects - Where to find them

<p dir=rtl>"<b>.I am the Architect</b>"<br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>fictitious character of)<br/>(<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not an exercise. This said not to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the TERM as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of advanced practices.

Let me explain my take.

## Intro

The spirit of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more baroque and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that coined the term _architect_<sup>🏛️</sup> centuries before Romans latinized it to *architecture*. 

Then it took ages till this trade had been formalized and acknowledged in the conservative art of construction.

Modern times spread the TERM *architecture* over miscellaneous spheres but as a metaphor to UNDERLINE the system COMPLEXITY. From exact vessels and hardware  to EPHEMER economics and politics. However, there's no **μ**archictect of processors, while architects of détente or economic miracle are more estimate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🏛️</sup> <sub>Greek: ἀρχιτέκτων, “master/chief builder/maker" but this occupation must have existed much prior as the Pyramids suggest.</sub>

Today the classical architect implies a refined craftsman, exempt from diverse narrow-profile routines to focus on vision, plan, and design.
