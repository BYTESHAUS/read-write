# Software Architects - Where to find them

<p dir=rtl>"<b>.I am the Architect</b>"<br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>fictitious character of)<br/>(<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. This said not to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices.

Let me explain such a take.

## Genesis

The spirit of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more baroque and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that coined the term _architect_<sup>🏛️</sup> centuries before Romans latinized *architecture* from it.

Then it took ages till the stationary art of construction acknowledged architects as a formalized trade - refined craftsmen, exempt from narrow-profile routines to focus on vision, blueprint, and design. With results from masterpieces down to indistinctive quarters.

In modern times *architecture* has become a loanword in miscellaneous spheres but more as a metaphor to underline the system complicacy. From mega-vessels and computers to less determinate economics and politics. However, **μ**arch hasn't brought microarchitects, while architects of détente or economic miracle are sooner for an estimate.

## Software vs. Building

The philosophical remark "Architecture is frozen music"<sup>🎼</sup> may project to software as: SYMPHONIC ORCHESTER MARATHON on 💊💊💊

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🎼</sup> <sub>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), falsely attributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full original quote: _Architektur ist gefrorene Musik. (Möge es immer beschwingt und harmonisch zugehen in diesem Haus!)_</sub>

### Why there's no pure architect

Software is less suited 

🚧🚧🚧 ... WORK in PROGRESS ... 🚧🚧🚧


### Factual roles and duties falsely assumed as the architect

Roles, positions, and occupations, that add up to software but don't make one an architect:

* team/project lead/manager
* lead/senior developer
* consultant,  tutor, or technology evangelist
* librarian - navigator, somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project
+ computer scientist
+ one who boils down requirements or/and documents the design
