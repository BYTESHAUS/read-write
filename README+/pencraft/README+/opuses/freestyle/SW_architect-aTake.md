# Finding Software Architect

<p dir=rtl><b><mark>".I am the Architect"</mark></b><br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>fictitious character of)<br/>(<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. 

**Let me explain such a take.** (This was not to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices.)

## Genesis

The spirit of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that they coined the term _architect_<sup>🏛️</sup> centuries before Romans latinized *architecture* from it.

Then it took ages till the immobile art of construction methodolized and acknowledged architects as a detached trade. That means refined craftsmen, exempt from narrow-profile routines and headaches to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.

In modern times miscellaneous spheres loaned *architecture* mostly as a metaphor to underline the system complicacy. From mega-vessels and supercomputers down to less determinate economics and politics. However, **μ**arch hasn't fostered microarchitects, while architects of détente or economic miracle are sooner for a compliment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🏛️</sup> <sub>Greek: ἀρχιτέκτων, “master/chief builder/maker" but this occupation must have existed much prior as the Pyramids suggest.</sub>

## Software vs. Building 

Architecture/Design of constructions and software has much in common. Both must yield functional products rather than aesthetic values.

Both must accumulate practices and reveal patterns.

Without a good plan, both will end up as a disastrous mess that will sooner or later loudly crash.

The diversity is much greater.

### Deltas

First, software is too fluid, and dynamic compared to static structures. 

The philosopher<sup>🎼</sup> who remarked "Architecture is frozen music" would find software as "GRAND GALA of symphonic cacophony MARATHON on 💊💊💊 under the circus tent".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🎼</sup> <sub>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), falsely attributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full original quote: _Architektur ist gefrorene Musik. (Möge es immer beschwingt und harmonisch zugehen in diesem Haus!)_</sub>

The lifecycle of construction is much longer.

Architecture results in masterpiece buildings and indistinctive typical constructions. The latter isn't for IT, where even tailoring the existing software isn't development.
 
 MUST BRING from  the aesthetic value to ART. NO Pantheon.


### Hypothesis

This said the software is least suitable for pure architects. 

IF NO_CODE THEN ELSE_IF CODE THEN

A determined person or board in high-pro fixed teams may rely on communication BUT ...


### Dissonance

Reputable software manufacturers hire _architects_, and they are the central figures at many IT events, there's certification after all.

First, *software architect* sounds cool. Then it may mean a permanent transit to a level over developers but still tech. It may be just a dream of one enlightened to draw beautiful top diagrams without digging in the dirty code. It's often an alias for these posts and duties:

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "librarian-navigator", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
+ _computer scientist_.

### Jack of all trades

HOW OFTEN TO BE ON THE SPOT?

* static vs dynamic
* versatile vs strict

Building are multifaceted but domains of SW even more.

## Wrap up

Architecture and design are synergies of 

Architecture artifacts rest on collective development.

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects are application of known arthitectural solutions with decent contribution. Much arch and desing solition are already solved in languages and platforms.
