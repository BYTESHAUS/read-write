# Software Architects - Where to find them

<p dir=rtl>"<b>.I am the Architect</b>"<br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>fictitious character of)<br/>(<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

Software architecture, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not an exercise. This said not to defame _software architects_ but to qualify it as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of advanced practices.
Let me explain my take.

## Intro

The conception of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more baroque and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that coined the term _architect_ centuries before Romans latinized it to a noun.<sup>🏛️</sup> 

Then it took epochs till this trade got formalized and acknowledged in the conservative art of static constructions.

In modern times architecture is applied in miscellaneous spheres with design or SYN0 overhead: from hardware and vessels to economics and politics. However, there's no **μ**archictect of processors, while architects of détente or economic miracle are more estimate.

The Latin term "architecture" emerged from the acts of building, and our information epoch spread it over other activities (up to buzzword). 
Hellenes coined the "architect" but it took centuries to distinguish and formalize this profession in the conservative art of static constructions.<sup>🏚️<sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:derelict_house:</sup> <sub>Authourship of vast blocks remains unclaimed.</sub>

The term migrated to other spheres and got obscure.

* static vs dynamic
* versatile vs strict

## Part 2. Software architect? Architects!

In my spoiled and biased opinion, there are no pure _software architects_ while architecture artifacts rest on collective development.

> If there's a microarchitecture is there microarchitecture? And nano?

Architecture, opposite to design, must be a platform-independent<sup>🎈</sup> abstraction which nevertheless must grow from the practical development.

## Appendices 

### Roles falsely granted as the architect

Roles, positions, and occupations, that add up to software but don't make one an architect:

* team/project lead/manager
* lead/senior developer
* consultant,  tutor, or technology evangelist
* librarian - navigator, somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project
+ computer scientist
+ one who boils down requirements or/and documents the design
