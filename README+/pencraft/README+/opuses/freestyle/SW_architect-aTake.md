# Finding Software Architect

<p dir=rtl><mark>"<b>.I am the Architect</b>"</mark><br />🎦&nbsp;<i>The Architect</i><br/>fictitious character of)<br/>(<i>The Matrix Reloaded</i></p>

*Software architecture*, whatever it means, is formalizable and veritable as a product, but not as an exercise. 

**Let me explain such a take.** (This was not to defame _software architects_ but to qualify the term as an honor rather than a job title for a bunch of avant practices.)

## Genesis

The spirit of architecture appeared as folks managed to erect something more extravagant and durable than a hut of piled branches. Ancient Greeks were so good at it that they coined the term _architect_<sup>🏛️</sup> centuries before Romans latinized *architecture* from it.

Then it took ages till the immobile art of construction methodolized and acknowledged architects as a detached trade. That means refined craftsmen, exempt from narrow-profile routines and headaches to focus on vision, design, blueprints, and aesthetics.

In modern times miscellaneous spheres loaned *architecture* mostly as a metaphor to underline the system complicacy. From mega-vessels and supercomputers down to less determinate economics and politics. However, **μ**arch hasn't fostered microarchitects, while architects of détente or economic miracle are sooner for a compliment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🏛️</sup> <sub>Greek: ἀρχιτέκτων, “master/chief builder/maker" but this occupation must have existed much prior as the Pyramids suggest.</sub>

## Software vs. Building 

Architecture/Design of constructions and software has much in common. Both must yield functional products rather than aesthetic values.

Both must accumulate practices and reveal patterns.

Without solid planning, both will end up as a disastrous MESS that will sooner or later loudly crash.

Diversities are larger.

### Radical odds

First, software is fluid, and dynamic compared to static constructions. The thinker who found "Architecture is frozen music"<sup>🎼</sup> would see software as "unleashed gala symphonic cacophony [under the circus tent]".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🎼</sup> <sub>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), also missattributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full original quote: _Architektur ist gefrorene Musik. (Möge es immer beschwingt und harmonisch zugehen in diesem Haus!)_</sub>

The timescale of software isn't only much DENSER, YOUND but EXPLODING. IT will be naive to keep templates, patterns as STABLE.
 


### Hypothesis

This said the software is least suitable for pure architects. 

One can't IMAGIMNE an arch zameshivauishivaego BETON, SOPROMAT.

One who doesn't deal with code

IF NO_CODE THEN ELSE_IF CODE THEN

A determined person or board in high-pro fixed teams may rely on communication BUT ...


### Dissonance

Reputable software manufacturers hire _architects_, and they are the central figures at many IT events, there's certification after all.

First, *software architect* sounds cool. Then it may mean a permanent transit to a level over developers but still tech. It may be just a dream of one enlightened to draw beautiful top diagrams without digging in the dirty code. It's often an alias for these posts and duties:

* _domain expert_ or _business analyst_, who boils down requirements to systematic description,
* _team lead_ or _project manager_,
* _lead_/_senior developer_,
* _consultant_, _tutor_, or _technology evangelist_, proposing blueprints for the solution,
* "librarian-navigator", somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project,
* geeks from _computer science_.

### Jack of all trades

HOW OFTEN TO BE ON THE SPOT?

* static vs dynamic
* versatile vs strict

Building are multifaceted but domains of SW even more.

## Wrap up

Architecture and design are synergies of 

Architecture artifacts rest on collective development.

MULTILEVEL and KNOW THE PREV LEVEL

And let's salt all this with a bitter reminder that most projects are application of known arthitectural solutions with decent contribution. Much arch and desing solition are already solved in languages and platforms.
