Immanuel Kant: “Experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play."

The Latin term "architecture" emerged from the acts of building, and our information epoch spread it over other activities (up to buzzword). 
Hellenes coined the "architect" but it took centuries to distinguish and formalize this profession in the conservative art of static constructions.<sup>🏚️<sup>

In my spoiled and biased opinion, there are no pure _software architects_ while architecture artifacts rest on collective development.


Architecture, opposite to design, must be a platform-independent<sup>🎈</sup> abstraction which nevertheless must grow from the practical development.

### Roles falsely granted as the architect

Roles, positions, and occupations, that add up to architecture but don't make one an architect:

* team/project lead/manager
* lead/senior dev
* librarian - navigator, somebody with the utmost knowledge of the project
* tutor * technology evangelist,
+ computer scientist
+ one who boils down requirements or/and makes sw docu
+ a lucky guy who may draw great diagrams, which are very loose coupled to actual software
