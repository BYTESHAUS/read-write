In my spoiled and biased opinion, there are no pure _software architects_ while architecture artifacts are based on collective development.

### Roles falsely granted as the architect

* team/project lead/manager
* lead/senior dev
* librarian
+ IT scientist
+ one who boils down requirements or/and makes sw docu
+ a lucky guy who may draw great diagrams, which are very loose coupled to actual software
