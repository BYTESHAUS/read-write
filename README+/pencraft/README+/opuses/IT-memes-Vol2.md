![Kant quote](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dare_to-know!-scarlet)

_Immanuel Kant_ for domain-driven design
> The only **objects** of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil.\
> For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason;\
by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason.

No mockery but a modest tribute to the 300th birthday of the considered one of the greatest philosophers.

<sup>🇩🇪</sup> <sub>Original: _Die alleinigen Objekte einer praktischen Vernunft sind also die vom Guten und Bösen. 
Denn durch das erstere versteht man einen notwendigen Gegenstand des Begehrungs-, 
durch das zweite des Verabscheuungsvermögens, beides aber nach einem Prinzip der Vernunft._\
_**Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788**_<sub>

> Where a calculator like ENIAC today is equipped with 18'000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, **computers in the future may** have only 1'000 vacuum tubes and perhaps **weigh only 1½ tons**.\
_Popular Mechanics, March 1949_

Wrongly quoted as futuristic cringe, it wasn't.

The same magazine over seven decades later: "Fully transistorized computer, the IBM 608, hit the market in late 1957. It weighed 1.2 tons."
