<p dir="rtl">?What makes a good quote<br/>
.Terse, witty? ‚Äî  That's for aphorisms<br/>

.Aging. - The criterion</p>

That's why here you find a VISIBLE inclination toward [IT pioneers](#IT-Pioneers) whose input to the theory **and** practice remained indisputable.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> Both&nbsp;their&nbsp;foresights and delusions count.

Quotes and epigraphs can be annoying, but I'm carefully picking only worthy ones that provoke a deeper understanding of IT. Good quotes are rare - not every expert speaks/writes/thinks in them and maintains their list.

> **Simplicity does not precede complexity but follows it.**\
_Alan Perlis_

![#architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Architecture-yellow) ![Kant quote](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dare_to-know!-scarlet)
> **Data abstractions provide the same benefits as procedures but for data.**\
_Barbara Liskov_

> **Without philosophy language design becomes hacking.**\
_Bjarne Stroustrup_

> My ideal of program design is to represent the concepts of the application domain directly in code. 
That way, if you understand the application domain, you understand the code and vice versa.\
_Bjarne Stroustrup_++

## Simplicity vs complexity

![#design](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Design-yellow) 

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no *obvious* deficiencies.\
&nbsp;\
The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature.

![#design](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Design-yellow) 

> The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.\
_Edsger W. Dijkstra_, 1970

![#design](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Methodolgy-yellow) 

> **Humans are allergic to change**. They love to say, "We've always done it this way."  **I try to fight that.**\
That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.\
*Grace Hopper*

## Testing

> Testing shows the presence not the absence of bugs.\
_Edsger W. Dijkstra_, 1969 (documented while the saying appeared before)

## Organisation

> A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict **discipline**, is in effect a universal machine.\
_Allan Turing_ (1948)

> One of my guiding principles is **don‚Äôt do anything that other people are doing. Always do something a little different if you can.** The concept is that if you do it a little differently there is a greater potential for reward than if you the same thing that other people are doing. I think that this kind of goal for one‚Äôs work, having obviously the maximum risk, would have the maximum reward no matter what the field may be.\
_Seymour Cray_

## Aged not that good

> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.\
_Alan Perlis_

> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.\
_Edsger W. Dijkstra_, 1975

The respected masters couldn't foresee the developing force's exponential growth and the entry threshold's dramatic sinking.

I venture to reformulate: "Most enough young and advanced in exact sciences can turn into good software developers but not vice versa".

## Controversial

<summary><b><ins>Maternity ward</ins></b></summary>

>  Everyone knows it takes a woman nine months to have a baby. But you Americans think if you get nine women pregnant, you can have a baby in a month.\
_Theodore von K√°rm√°n_ (1957)

It would be ok for this specific case but _Fred Brooks_ popularized it in [The Mythical Man-Month]()<sup>üîó</sup>:

> The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.

Not only derogatory but illogical. Finding nine women in the vicinity who will deliver ten babies in half a month will take a couple of days. 

_Edsger W.&nbsp;Dijkstra_ conveyed the idea much more plausible (albeit about languages, 1975):

> It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with **ten** blunt axes instead.

(I could only add that the sharpest axes in clumsy hands may have already destroyed a pencil beyond repair.)

> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to **BASIC**: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.\
_Edsger W. Dijkstra_, 1975

> ALGOL quotes

My opinion is that languages such as Basic offer an easy EINSTIEG to newbies and NUBs (i even stated this in my [LN REMINISCENCE](LN-view.md))

> So programming languages on the whole are very much more complicated than they used to be: **object orientation, inheritance,** and other features are still not really being thought through from the point of view of a coherent and scientifically well-based discipline or a theory of correctness.\
...

_C.A.R. (Tony) Hoare_, 2002 in interview

<details><summary>Full quote...</summary>
 What‚Äôs happened is that practical programmers have used whatever understanding they‚Äôve gained, or theoreticians have offered them, to increase complexity. So programming languages on the whole are very much more complicated than they used to be: object orientation, inheritance, and other features are still not really being thought through from the point of view of a coherent and scientifically well-based discipline or a theory of correctness. My original postulate, which I have been pursuing as a scientist all my life, is that one uses the criteria of correctness as a means of converging on a decent programming language design‚Äîone which doesn‚Äôt set traps for its users, and ones in which the different components of the program correspond clearly to different components of its specification, so you can reason compositionally about it. Programming languages in full generality have not really paid full attention to this aspect. They tend to be defined purely on the basis of what the  29 machine does when it‚Äôs executing the program, and often at quite a low level of granularity too‚Äîindividual storage accesses. I still think we have to get the message across. The tools, including the compiler, have to be based on some theory of what it means to write a correct program.

> Where a calculator like ENIAC today is equipped with 18'000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, **computers in the future may** have only 1'000 vacuum tubes and perhaps **weigh only 1¬Ω tons**.\
_Popular Mechanics, March 1949_

Wrongly quoted as futuristic cringe, it wasn't.

The same magazine over seven decades later: "Fully transistorized computer, the IBM 608, hit the market in late 1957. It weighed 1.2 tons."

Yes. Again, I very much doubt that the sentiment is original.\
Of course, all "there are only two" quotes have to be taken with a grain of salt.\

> ... the realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.\
_Maurice Wilkes_

It's quoted sometimes as an appeal to quality but it's indeed a curious fact about the former hardware.

<details><summary>Full quote</summary>
 
> By June 1949 people had begun to realize that it was not so easy to get programs right as at one time appeared. I well remember when this realization first came on me with full force.
The EDSAC was on the top floor of the building and the tape-punching and editing equipment one floor below. [...] It was on one of my journeys between the EDSAC room and the punching equipment that "hesitating at the angles of stairs" the realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.
