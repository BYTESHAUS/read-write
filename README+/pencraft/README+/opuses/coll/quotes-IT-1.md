<p dir="rtl">?What makes a good quote<br/>
.Terse, witty? ‚Äî  That's for aphorisms<br/>
.Brainy, ingenious? ‚Äî Prerequisite<br/>
.Aging. - The criterion</p>

That's why here you find a definite inclination toward [IT pioneers](#IT-Pioneers) whose input to the theory **and** practice remained indisputable.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> Both&nbsp;their&nbsp;foresights and delusions count.

Quotes can be annoying but here I'm carefully picking only worthy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>Whose work backed up physicists and engineers of the Manhattan Project or Saturn, but not that popularized - only Turing got an A-movie (as far as I know).</sub>

> Simplicity does not precede complexity but follows it.\
_Alan Perlis_

![#architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Architecture-yellow) ![Kant quote](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dare_to-know!-scarlet)
> Data abstractions provide the same benefits as procedures but for data.\
_Barbara Liskov_

> Without philosophy language design becomes hacking.
_Bjarne Stroustrup_


## Simplicity vs complexity

![#design](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Design-yellow) 

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no *obvious* deficiencies.\
&nbsp;\
The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature.

![#design](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Design-yellow) 

> The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.\
_Edsger W. Dijkstra_ (1970)

![#design](https://img.shields.io/badge/%23-Methodolgy-yellow) 

> **Humans are allergic to change**. They love to say, "We've always done it this way."  **I try to fight that.**\
That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.\
*Grace Hopper*

## Organisation

> A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict **discipline**, is in effect a universal machine.\
_Allan Turing_ (1948)

> One of my guiding principles is **don‚Äôt do anything that other people are doing. Always do something a little different if you can.** The concept is that if you do it a little differently there is a greater potential for reward than if you the same thing that other people are doing. I think that this kind of goal for one‚Äôs work, having obviously the maximum risk, would have the maximum reward no matter what the field may be.\
_Seymour Cray_

> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.\

> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.\
Edsger W. Dijkstra (1975)


I could imagine a mathematician/physicist converted to keyboard plankton but ...

## Controversial

<summary><b><ins>Maternity ward</ins></b></summary>

>  Everyone knows it takes a woman nine months to have a baby. But you Americans think if you get nine women pregnant, you can have a baby in a month.\
_Theodore von K√°rm√°n_ (1957)

It would be ok for this specific case but _Fred Brooks_ popularized it in [The Mythical Man-Month]()<sup>üîó</sup>:

> The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.


Not only derogatory but illogical. Finding nine women in the vicinity who will deliver ten babies in half a month will take a couple of days. 

Edsger W. Dijkstra conveyed the idea much more plausible (albeit about languages, 1975):

> It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with **ten** blunt axes instead.

> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to **BASIC**: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

My opinion is that languages as Basic offer an easy EINSTIEG to newbies and NUBs (i even stated this in my [LN REMINISCENCE](LN-view.md))

> Where a calculator like ENIAC today is equipped with 18'000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, **computers in the future may** have only 1'000 vacuum tubes and perhaps **weigh only 1¬Ω tons**.\
_Popular Mechanics, March 1949_

Wrongly quoted as futuristic cringe, it wasn't.

The same magazine over seven decades later: "Fully transistorized computer, the IBM 608, hit the market in late 1957. It weighed 1.2 tons."

> "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses".\
Yes. Again, I very much doubt that the sentiment is original.\
Of course, all "there are only two" quotes have to be taken with a grain of salt.\

> ... the realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.

> By June 1949 people had begun to realize that it was not so easy to get programs right as at one time appeared. I well remember when this realization first came on me with full force.
The EDSAC was on the top floor of the building and the tape-punching and editing equipment one floor below. [...] It was on one of my journeys between the EDSAC room and the punching equipment that "hesitating at the angles of stairs" the realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.\
