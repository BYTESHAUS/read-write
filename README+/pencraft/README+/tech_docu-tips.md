### Pictograms / emojis

Small images are smart helpers to annotate, navigate, and focus unless heavily overused. They may apply to everything - text, solution items (folders and filenames), and even program output (UTF-8 glyphs to rescue).

## Wrap up

**Last but not least** - stamp with ending sign or note.

Ensure yourself and your readers that it was the intentional ending. Use custom note (like below), typographical ["tombstone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(typography)), or exquisite [Q.E.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.)
