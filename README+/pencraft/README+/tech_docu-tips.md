# Technical documentation - Tips

## Content

### Split the flow.

Long-running sentences, paragraphs, and chapters are first-degree misdemeanors.

Do you think this commonplace deserves a reminder? Yes, it still has to be met everywhere, and it has become poignant in the era of smartphones.

### Emphasizing

* Except for citations use quotation marks for metaphors while _italic_ to introduce terms. Example:
> To compare _multitasking_ vs. _parallelism_ imagine the CPU being a "kitchen" where a quick cook vs. an orderly brigade can prepare the same courses.

## Navigation 

### Totals

* Numbering totals will keep readers and editors focused.\

## Characters and symbols 

### Replacements

Many typography symbols may appear in text when markup is broken. To exclude doubts it's better to insert their symbolic versions, escape tags or codes when possible:

* <mark>“”</mark>, <mark>«»</mark>, or <mark>\&quot;</mark> instead of <mark>""</mark>,
* <mark>⟨ ⟩</mark> or <mark>\&lt; \&gt;</mark> instead of angle brackets <mark><></mark>,
* <mark>\&amp;</mark> for &\
_and so on_.

### Helpers

Besides replacement use <mark>\&mdash;</mark> for long dash, <mark>\&nbsp</mark> for non-breakable space, and so on.

### Pictograms / emojis

Small images are smart helpers to annotate, navigate, and focus unless heavily overused. They may apply to everything - text, solution items (folders and filenames), and even program output (UTF-8 glyphs to rescue).

A team should limit them to a subset<sup>🍋</sup>, define the exact meaning of most, and put some on a blacklist (for ambiguity or cultural issues).

## Checklist

## Wrap up

**Last but not least** - stamp with ending sign or note.

Ensure yourself and your readers that it was the intentional ending. Use custom note (like below), typographical ["tombstone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(typography)), or exquisite [Q.E.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.)
