# Technical documentation - Tips

* **Split the flow.** Long-running sentences, paragraphs, and chapters are first-degree misdemeanors.

Does this commonplace need a reminder? Yes, it still has to be met everywhere, and in the era of smartphones become poignant.

* Except for citations use quotation marks for metaphors while _italic_ to introduce terms. Example:
> To compare _multitasking_ vs. _parallelism_ imagine the CPU being a "kitchen" where a quick cook vs. an orderly brigade can prepare the same courses.

+ **Last but not least** - stampe with ending sign or note.

To ensure yourself and your readers that it was the intentional ending. Use custom note (like below), typographical ["tombstone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(typography)), or exquisite [Q.E.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.)
