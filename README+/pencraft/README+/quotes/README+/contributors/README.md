### IT Pioneers

There's a discernible inclination in quotes toward the mathematicians and engineers who stood behind the first computers. Whose, no better word, fundamental input to the theory **and** practice remained indisputable.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> Both&nbsp;their&nbsp;foresights and enough delusions count.

\_________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>Whose work backed up physicists and engineers of the Manhattan Project, Mercury or Saturn, but not that popularized - only Turing got an A-movie (as far as I know).</sub>

#### John von Neumann

_John von Neumann_ (**1903**, Budapest - 1957, Washington, D.C. 🇺🇸)<sup>👽</sup> one of IT founders, _inter alia_ mathematician with the widest coverage. 

One of the numerous honoring quotes about him: «Most mathematicians prove what they can, von Neumann proves what he wants.» (_Paul Halmos_)

Fun fact: searching for _von Neumann_ without the first name will list first namesake artifacts (like theorems).

#### Grace Hopper

_Grace Brewster Hopper_, née Murray (**1906**-1992), 🇺🇸 grandma of Cobol, finder of the moth that opened the debugging world (that queer chords with her name).

#### Alan Turing

Dr. _Alan Mathison Turing_ 🇬🇧 (**1912**-1954), Cambridge, Princeton

Enough to say that many on this list got the prize of his name<sup>🥇</sup> as the highest distinction in IT.

#### Maurice Wilkes

_Maurice Vincent Wilkes_ 🇬🇧 (June 26, **1913** – November 29, 2010)<sup>🥇</sup>

Designer of the earliest stored program computers (EDSAC, 1949) and inventor of **μ**programming,

#### Richard Hamming

_Richard Wesley Hamming_ (**1915** 🇺🇸 - 1988), a mathematician known for prize-winning IT solutions

#### Alan Perlis

_Alan Jay Perlis_ (**1922** Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania :us: - 1990)<sup>🥇</sup> MIT, one of the ALGOL founders

#### Ted Codd

_Edgar Frank "Ted" Codd_ 🇬🇧 (**1923**-2003)<sup>🥇</sup> IBM, Oxford, who made databases relational (vs Network data model introduced by Charles Bachman and others)

#### Charles Bachman

_Charles William Bachman III_ 🇺🇸 (**1924**-2017)<sup>🥇</sup> who invented the DBMS and changed the business of GE.

A rare pure engineer among IT founders, and one who visited the White House to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation personally from the President.\

#### Seymour Cray

_Seymour Roger Cray_ 🇺🇸 (1925-1996), UoM, father of supercomputers

#### Edsger W. Dijkstra

_Edsger Wybe Dijkstra_ 🇳🇱 (**1930**, Rotterdam  - 2002)🇳🇱<sup>🥇</sup> known also for a [graph algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)

 The inventor of _mutex_, ¿the abolisher of `goto`? (sorry, it was _Niklaus Wirth_).

#### Fred Brooks

_Frederick Phillips Brooks Jr._ (**1931**-2022)<sup>🥇</sup> known for IBM	OS/360

#### Gerald Weinberg

_Gerald Marvin Weinberg_ (**1933** - 2018) 🇺🇸, UMich, IBM, a computer scientist, a teacher of the psychology and anthropology of software.

#### Tony Hoare

_C.A.R. Hoare_, _Charles Antony Richard Hoare_ (born **1934**)<sup>🥇</sup> a fundamental contributor to programming languages and algorithms

#### Niklaus Wirth

_Niklaus Emil Wirth_ (**1934** - 2024)🇨🇭 <sup>🥇</sup> inventor of Pascal and other languages

#### Donald Knuth

_Donald Ervin Knuth_ (born **1938** Milwaukee, Wisconsin 🇺🇸)<sup>🥇</sup> one of the first and most prominent computer scientists, best known for _The Art of Computer Programming_, 1962-1973

#### Barbara Liskov

Prof. _Barbara Jane Liskov_, née _Huberman_ (born **1939**) 🇺🇸 <sup>🥇</sup> MIT, awardee of multiple prizes (incl. Turing), the only one honored with a personal letter in [SO**L**ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

Data abstraction concepts, to which she mostly contributed, became natural as the mother tongue but then it was *terra incognita*.

Prof. Liskov: «One advantage to being in the field so early was that great problems were sitting there. All you had to do was jump on them.»

### Math / Phys

#### George Pólya

Prof. _George Pólya_ (**1887**-1985)<sup>👽</sup> mathematician, Zürich, Stanford

He is distinguished for his endowment in the pedagogics of mathematics. One of his students was _John von Neumann_.

#### Bjarne Stroustrup

Bjarne Stroustrup (1950, Aarhus 🇩🇰) /ˈbjɑːrnə ˈstrɒvstrʊp/ father of C++, evangelist of paradigms.
Beyond the great programming, he did a good job of maintaining his own [quotes](https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html)<sup>:link:</sup> saving us from misinterpretations.
