### IT Pioneers

There's a discernible inclination in quotes toward the mathematicians and engineers who stood behind the first computers. Whose, no better word, fundamental input to the theory **and** practice remained indisputable.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> Both&nbsp;their&nbsp;foresights and enough delusions count.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>Whose work backed up physicists and engineers of the Manhattan Project, Mercury or Saturn, but not that popularized - only Turing got an A-movie (as far as I know).</sub>

#### John von Neumann

_John von Neumann_ (**1903** - 1957)<span title="Martians as scientific group"><sup>👽</sup></span> one of IT founders, _inter alia_ mathematician with the widest coverage. 

One of the numerous honoring quotes about him: «Most mathematicians prove what they can, von Neumann proves what he wants.» (_Paul Halmos_)

Fun fact: searching for _von Neumann_ (without the first name) will recite first namesake artifacts, like theorems.

_Charles William Bachman III_ (**1924**-2017)<sup title="Turing Award, 1973">🥇</sup> who invented the DBMS and changed the business of GE.
