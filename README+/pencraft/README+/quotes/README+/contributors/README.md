### IT Pioneers

There's a discernible inclination in quotes here toward the mathematicians and engineers who stood behind the first computers. Whose, no better word, fundamental input to the theory **and** practice remained indisputable.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> Both&nbsp;their&nbsp;foresights and enough delusions count.

\_________

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup> <sub>Whose work backed up physicists and engineers of the Manhattan Project or Saturn, but not that popularized - only Turing got an A-movie (as far as I know).</sub>

#### John von Neumann

_John von Neumann_ (**1903**, Budapest - 1957, Washington, D.C. 🇺🇸), one of IT founders, _inter alia_ mathematician with the widest coverage in his time. 

One of the numerous bright quotes about him: "Most mathematicians prove what they can, von Neumann proves what he wants." (_Paul Halmos_, mathematician)

Fun fact: searching for _von Neumann_ without the first name will bring primary a list of artifacts (like theorems) given his name.

#### Grace Hopper

_Grace Brewster Hopper_, née Murray (**1906**-1992), 🇺🇸 grandma of Cobol, finder of the moth that opened the debugging world (which queerly chords with her name).

#### Alan Turing

_Alan Mathison Turing_ (**1912**-1954)

#### Maurice Wilkes

_Maurice Vincent Wilkes_ 🇬🇧 (June 26, **1913** – November 29, 2010) 

designer of the earliest stored program computers (EDSAC, 1949) and inventor of **μ**programming,

#### Richard Hamming

_Richard Wesley Hamming_ (**1915** 🇺🇸 - 1988), a mathematician known for prize-winning IT solutions

#### Alan Perlis

_Alan Jay Perlis_ (**1922** Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania :us: - 1990), MIT, one of the ALGOL founders

#### Ted Codd

_Edgar Frank "Ted" Codd_ 🇬🇧 (**1923**-2003) IBM, Oxford, who made databases relational (vs Network data model introduced by Charles Bachman and others)

#### Charles Bachman

_Charles William Bachman III_ 🇺🇸 (**1924**-2017) who invented the DBMS and changed the business of GE.

A rare pure engineer among IT founders, and one who visited the White House to receive a National Medal of Technology and Innovation personally from the President.\

#### Seymour Cray

_Seymour Roger Cray_ 🇺🇸 (1925-1996), UoM, father of supercomputers

 The inventor of _mutex_, ?the abolisher of `goto`? (sorry, it was _Niklaus Wirth_).

#### Fred Brooks

_Frederick Phillips Brooks Jr._ (**1931**-2022), known for IBM	OS/360
