<p dir="rtl">?What makes a good quote<br/>
.Terse, witty? —  That's for aphorisms<br/>
.Brainy, ingenious? — Prerequisites<br/>
.Context-free. — The criterion</p>

* Quotes and epigraphs can be annoying, but only worthy ones are cherry-picked for this paper to provoke deeper IT thinking. 
* Looking for quotes gets arduous - not every expert spoke/wrote/thought in them and maintained their list.
* To keep the selection genuine sarcasm and dubiety are avoided here.

## Aged good

> **Simplicity does not precede complexity but follows it.**\
[Alan Perlis](contributors/README.md#Alan-Perlis)

## Abstraction

> **The entire history of software engineering is that of the rise in levels of abstraction**.\
[Grady Booch](contributors/README.md#Grady-Booch), 2003

> **Data abstractions provide the same benefits as procedures but for data.**\
[Barbara Liskov](contributors/README.md#Barbara-Liskov)

> `AND` and `OR` are the basic operations of logic. Together with `NO` they are a complete set of basic logical operations — **all other logical operations**, no matter how complex, **can be obtained by suitable combinations of these**.\
[John von Neumann](contributors/README.md#John-von-Neumann)

> **Without philosophy language design becomes hacking.**\
[Bjarne Stroustrup](contributors/README.md#Bjarne-Stroustrup)

> My ideal of program design is to represent the concepts of the application domain directly in code. 
That way, if you understand the application domain, you understand the code and vice versa.\
[Bjarne Stroustrup](contributors/README.md#Bjarne-Stroustrup)

> The people at the bottom do not have the larger, global view, but at the top they do not have the local view of all the details, many of which can often be very important, so **either extreme gets poor results**.\
[Richard Hamming](contributors/README.md#Richard-Hamming)

> Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a **computer**. Art is everything else we do.\
[Donald Knuth](contributors/README.md#Donald-Knuth)

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no *obvious* deficiencies.\
&nbsp;\
The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature.

> The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra), 1970

> **Humans are allergic to change**. They love to say, "We've always done it this way."  **I try to fight that.**\
That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.\
[Grace Hopper](contributors/README.md#Grace-Hopper)

### Docu and comments

> When you feel the need to write a comment, first try to refactor the code so **that any comment becomes superfluous**.\
[Kent Beck](contributors/README.md#Kent-Beck), "Refactoring", 1999

## Quality assurance

> **Testing shows the presence not the absence of bugs.**\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra), 1969 (documented while the saying appeared before)

> The key is to **test the areas that you are most worried about going wrong**. That way you get the most benefit for your testing effort. It is better to write and run incomplete tests than not to run complete tests.\
[Kent Beck](contributors/README.md#Kent-Beck), "Refactoring", 1999

{QA!!!}
> **I find it very odd.** I’m a fairly private person who just sits in front of the computer and hacks on code.\
_Andres Freund_, 2024, a programmer who occasionally prevented the "century" cyberattack, [NYT interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/technology/prevent-cyberattack-linux.html).

## Organisation

> A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict **discipline**, is in effect a universal machine.\
[Allan Turing](contributors/README.md#Allan-Turing) (1948)

> When I read commentary about suggestions for where C should go, I often think back and give thanks that it wasn`t developed under the advice of a worldwide crowd.\
[Dennis_Ritchie](contributors/README.md#Dennis-Ritchie)

> One of my guiding principles is **don’t do anything that other people are doing. Always do something a little different if you can.** The concept is that if you do it a little differently there is a greater potential for reward than if you the same thing that other people are doing. I think that this kind of goal for one’s work, having obviously the maximum risk, would have the maximum reward no matter what the field may be.\
