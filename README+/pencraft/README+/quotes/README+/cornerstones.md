# IT - Quotes - Cornerstones

* Quotes and epigraphs can be annoying, their hackneyed selections migrate between resources &mdash; only worthy ones are cherry-picked here to provoke deeper IT thinking. 
* Looking for quotes gets arduous - not every expert spoke/wrote/thought in them and maintained their list, and not every best is in _wikiquote_.
