>  Everyone knows it takes a woman nine months to have a baby. But you Americans think if you get nine women pregnant, you can have a baby in a month.\
_Theodore von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n_ (1957)

It would be ok for this specific case but _Fred Brooks_ popularized it in [The Mythical Man-Month]()<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>:

> The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.

Not only derogatory but illogical. Finding nine women in the vicinity who will deliver ten babies in half a month will take a couple of days. 

[Edsger W. Dijkstra](contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra) conveyed the idea much more plausible (albeit about languages, 1975):

> It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with **ten** blunt axes instead.

(I could only add that the sharpest axes in clumsy hands may have already destroyed a pencil beyond repair.)

> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to **BASIC**: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra), 1975

> C++ is a badly designed and ugly language. It would be a shame to use it in Emacs.\
_Richard Stallman_

> FORTRANâ€”the "infantile disorder" by now nearly 20 years old, is hopelessly inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today: it is now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use.\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra)

> <mark>C++ is a language strongly optimized for liars and people who go by guesswork and ignorance.</mark>\
_Erik Naggum_, Lisp programmer, 2008 on Usenet

Sure, an environment may force bad practices but they don't make developers.

<details><summary>Full quote...</summary>
 Whatâ€™s happened is that practical programmers have used whatever understanding theyâ€™ve gained, or theoreticians have offered them, to increase complexity. So programming languages on the whole are very much more complicated than they used to be: object orientation, inheritance, and other features are still not really being thought through from the point of view of a coherent and scientifically well-based discipline or a theory of correctness. My original postulate, which I have been pursuing as a scientist all my life, is that one uses the criteria of correctness as a means of converging on a decent programming language designâ€”one which doesnâ€™t set traps for its users, and ones in which the different components of the program correspond clearly to different components of its specification, so you can reason compositionally about it. Programming languages in full generality have not really paid full attention to this aspect. They tend to be defined purely on the basis of what the  29 machine does when itâ€™s executing the program, and often at quite a low level of granularity tooâ€”individual storage accesses. I still think we have to get the message across. The tools, including the compiler, have to be based on some theory of what it means to write a correct program.
