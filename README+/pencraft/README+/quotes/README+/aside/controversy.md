# Quotes > Backshelve &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; 🔥C<samp>ONTROVERSY</samp>

> **Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.**\
[Linus Torvalds](../contributors/README.md#Linus-Torvalds)

Master _Torvalds_ could have meant renowned open-source contributors, but most smart guys in IT are for and because of wages, and it was never fun in commercial development.

### Maternity ward

> **Everyone knows it takes a woman nine months to have a baby. But you Americans think if you get nine women pregnant, you can have a baby in a month.**\
_Theodore von Kármán_ (1957)

It suited a private aviation engineering talk, but [Fred Brooks](../contributors/README.md#Fred-Brooks) popularized the phrase in his [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)<sup><b>w</b></sup>:

> The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.

Derogatory and illogical. Finding expert developers who can save a failing project ASAP is a question of payment. (Finding nine women in a city who will deliver even **ten** babies in less than a month is a fast radial search.) 

[Edsger W. Dijkstra](../contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra) conveyed the idea much more plausibly (albeit about programming languages, 1975):

> It is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with **ten** blunt axes instead.

(To add only that the sharpest axes in clumsy hands may have already destroyed all found pencils beyond repair.)

## Idealism

> **Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.** Code for readability.\
_John F. Woods_, /comp.lang.c++/, 1991

This accidental quote in a newsgroup became one of the most cited in IT (often for fun). Unrealistic and excessive "always" (harmful and wrong) demotivates aspiration to [quality code](../../../../../software/QA/code_quality).

> **Software is Art.**\
(Eavesdropped from a Product Owner)

It is pleasing but barely real &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; there are no galleries of Old Masters with Algol listings.

## Techniques

> **To iterate is human, to recurse divine.**\
> [L. Peter Deutsh](../contributors/README.md#peter-deutsch)

Recursion is a great mathematical tool and an elegant software trick. 

However, for the latter, it's error-prone and may end up with a stack overflow. That's why it was prohibited in many mission-critical programs.

## Bitter words

### QA

> **If builders built houses the way programmers built programs, the first <mark>woodpecker</mark> to come along would destroy civilization.**\
Attributed to [Gerald Weinberg](../contributors/README.md#Gerald-Weinberg)

Knowing the high-responsibility software in which Mr.&nbsp;Weinberg participated, one would strongly doubt his authorship. Unless it was a sheer joke.

Despite all the epic failures, software, on which our life depends, is extremely robust and, contrary, has made the world safer (consider IT behind 50'000 daily civil aviation flights). 

The aphorism shall be better: "If the software were built like houses, custom projects would be a luxury."

### Languages
 
> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to **BASIC**: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](../contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra), 1975

> **FORTRAN** &mdash; the "infantile disorder" by now nearly 20 years old, is hopelessly inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today: it is now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use.\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](../contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra)

> **C++** is a badly designed and ugly language. It would be a shame to use it in Emacs.\
[Richard Stallman](../contributors/README.md#Richard-Stallman)

> <mark><b>C++</b> is a language strongly optimized for liars and people who go by guesswork and ignorance.</mark> 🤦‍♂️\
_Erik Naggum_, Lisp programmer, 2008 on Usenet

Sure, an environment may provoke bad practices, but it don't make developers. Vice versa, limitations can stimulate optimization, abstraction, pattern thinking, and the search for nontrivial escapes. 

### Paradigms
 
> So programming languages on the whole are very much more complicated than they used to be: **object orientation, inheritance,** and other features are still not really being thought through from the point of view of a coherent and scientifically well-based discipline or a theory of correctness.\
[C.A.R. (Tony) Hoare](../contributors/README.md#Tony-Hoare), in interview, 2002

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;Full quote...&nbsp;</ins></summary>
 <p>What’s happened is that practical programmers have used whatever understanding they’ve gained, or theoreticians have offered them, to increase complexity.</p>
<p>So programming languages on the whole are very much more complicated than they used to be: object orientation, inheritance, and other features are still not really being thought through from the point of view of a coherent and scientifically well-based discipline or a theory of correctness.</p>
<p>My original postulate, which I have been pursuing as a scientist all my life, is that one uses the criteria of correctness as a means of converging on a decent programming language design &mdash; one which doesn’t set traps for its users, and ones in which the different components of the program correspond clearly to different components of its specification, so you can reason compositionally about it.</p>
<p>Programming languages in full generality have not really paid full attention to this aspect. They tend to be defined purely on the basis of what the machine does when it’s executing the program, and often at quite a low level of granularity too &mdash; individual storage accesses.</p>
<p>I still think we have to get the message across. The tools, including the compiler, have to be based on some theory of what it means to write a correct program.</p>

It suffies to say that OOP/OOD prevailed in software development then and remains prevalent today.

## Bad advice

### Writing/documentation

> **Plot is the last resort of bad writers.**\
_Stephen Edwin King_

Whether one has read books by Mr. King or not, likes them or not, the indisputable fact is that he remains an incredibly prolific author of bestselling stuff for decades (and a worthy person).

Following this and his other conclusions for authoring is like teaching a kid to ride a city bike from downhill champions.\
