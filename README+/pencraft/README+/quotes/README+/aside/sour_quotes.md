> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.\
[Alan Perlis](contributors/README.md#Alan-Perlis)

> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra), 1975

The respected masters couldn't foresee the developing force's exponential growth and the entry threshold's dramatic sinking.

I venture to reformulate: "Most enough young and advanced in exact sciences can turn into good software developers but not vice versa".

> **If builders built houses the way programmers built programs, the first woodpecker to come along would destroy civilization.**\
Attributed to _Gerald Weinberg_

Knowing the high-responsibility software in which Mr.&nbsp;Weinberg participated one would strongly doubt his authorship. Or it was an explicit joke.

Despite all epic failures, software, on which our life depends, is extremely robust and contrary made the world safer. The aphorism shall better be: "If the software is built like houses, customers will wait decades for change requests.",

> The programmer's primary weapon in the **never-ending battle against slow system** is to change the intramodular structure.\
_Fred Brooks_

I dare say that resources and performance are no longer a headache for the majority of applications.

> **Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.**\
[Niklaus Wirth](contributors/README.md#Niklaus-Wirth), 1995, "A Plea for Lean Software" (aka Wirth's law)

Much has changed since the 1990s when sparing half a byte was _bon ton_. Things like auto memory allocation with garbage collection and intermediate languages appeared only because the hardware could facilitate them.
