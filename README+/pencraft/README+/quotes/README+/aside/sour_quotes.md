# IT Quotes - Aged not that good

## Skills

### Math
 
> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.\
[Alan Perlis](../contributors/README.md#Alan-Perlis)

> Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.\
[Edsger W. Dijkstra](../contributors/README.md#Edsger-W-Dijkstra), 1975

The respected masters couldn't foresee the developing force's exponential growth and the entry threshold's dramatic sinking.

I venture to reformulate: "Most enough young and advanced in exact sciences can turn into good software developers but not vice versa".

## Software

### Languages

> **In 30 years <mark>Lisp</mark> will likely be ahead of C++/Java (but behind something else).**\
_Peter Norvig_, computer scientist at Google, **1999**

After **25** years miscellaneous metrics place `Java` in the top five, and `C++` &mdash; in ten. `Lisp` is on the margins.


## Hardware

### Performance 

> The programmer's primary weapon in the **never-ending battle against slow system** is to change the intramodular structure.\
[Fred Brooks](../contributors/README.md#Fred-Brooks)

I dare say that resources and performance are no longer a headache for the majority of applications.

> **Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.**\
[Niklaus Wirth](../contributors/README.md#Niklaus-Wirth), 1995, "A Plea for Lean Software" (aka Wirth's law)

Much has changed since the 1990s when sparing half a byte was a big trick. The mercy of auto memory allocation with garbage collection and intermediate languages came only because the hardware could facilitate them.
