## Intro

> **If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.**\
<s>Albert Einstein</s> 🤦‍♂️🤦🤦‍♀️

The backside of scientific fame is that the figure of Albert Einstein (but not he) became the King of misattributed citation. And this quote, beloved in sci-pop and crash courses, is a shining diamond in the crown of dubious authorship.

Dr.&nbsp;Einstein would be the least thinker for such an idea. **Nobody can explain a thesis simply** (or in detail) **if the learner doesn't know the subject fundamentally.** Not every wizard will even remember the learning path left behind.

> Where a calculator like ENIAC today is equipped with 18'000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, **computers in the future may** have only 1'000 vacuum tubes and perhaps **weigh only 1½ tons**.\
_Popular Mechanics, March 1949_

Wrongly quoted as futuristic cringe, it wasn't.

The same magazine over seven decades later: «Fully transistorized computer, the IBM 608, hit the market in late 1957. It weighed 1.2 tons.»

> "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses".\
Yes. Again, I very much doubt that the sentiment is original.\
Of course, all "there are only two" quotes have to be taken with a grain of salt.\

> ... the realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.\
[Maurice Wilkes](../contributors/README.md#Maurice-Wilkes)

It's sometimes quoted as an appeal to quality, but it's indeed a curious fact about the scale of former hardware.

> By June 1949 people had begun to realize that it was not so easy to get programs right as at one time appeared. I well remember when this realization first came on me with full force.
The EDSAC was on the top floor of the building and the tape-punching and editing equipment one floor below. [...] It was on one of my journeys between the EDSAC room and the punching equipment that "hesitating at the angles of stairs" the realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs.
