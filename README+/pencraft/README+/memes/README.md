[![... then IT must be a waterfall.](../../../_rsc/_img/memes/ITLearnWaterfall_horiz.png)](../../../software/)

The grains of truth in this wisdom:

* No other knowledge erodes so quickly as the IT tech stack - languages/scripts, markup, frameworks, and their IDEs, UX styles emerge, submerge, and mutate with the year's pace.<sup>:violin:</sup>
* In the orthogonal  (to time) dimension a developer can't stick to a favorite syntax and must be fluent in a wide techno spectrum.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:violin:</sup> <sub>Javascript/HTML, which one learned in 2000, remains only as basic syntax. It went through numerous libs, polyfills, jQuery, and other cool tools and at the moment transformed into single-page frameworks, which rule the web dev.</sub>

> Don't swim against the current. Stay in the river, become the river; and the river is already going to the sea. This is the great teaching.\
— _Rajneesh, aka Osho_ (1931-1990)

Translated east-to-west this means: find a sinecure in a big company.

And ... the twist! It was a real random number, while algorithms generate only pseudo-random ones.

As the extraordinary [John von&nbsp;Neumann](../quotes/README+/contributors/README.md#John-von-Neumann) stressed:

> Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.

Justified: abilities in exact sciences are no longer a prerequisite for applied programming. 
It's normal to neglect a sorting algorithm implementation (that a platform provides) rather than to write one's own or even comprehend/differentiate one.

A stack of punch cards for a casual program. I'm proud to have a [little experience](../essays/README+/punchcard.md) of dealing with them
