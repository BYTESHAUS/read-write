I remastered and enhanced that.

  The lore goes that computer scientists (every programmer was one), senior in age and title, used relatively idle nighttime<sup>ðŸŒ›</sup> to connect their computer centers 
  via antediluvian wide area networks and combat resources with all possible (for warming up) and impossible, and unthinkable hacks in _machine languages_.
    
 Only codes, only hardcore &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; no hardware manipulations, no dirty cheats, no vulgar social engineering.
   
The winner occupied the most or all of the memory of the opponents' time slots.

These sagas remained unnoticed in the mass culture since ultra-level abstraction is required to grasp what silent battles unfolded in darkness over bits (not bytes).

<sup>ðŸŒ›</sup> <sub>Relatively, since computer time was so deficient, a couple of hours in night shifts on BIG machines was a big luck for junior fellows (daytime was out of reach for them at all).</sub>
