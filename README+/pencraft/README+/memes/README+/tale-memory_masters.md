### The lore goes in times of two-row monochrome text monitors (if not arrays of light bulbs) when every programmer was a computer scientist, or a mathematician, or both.

Those senior in age and title occupied relatively idle nighttime<sup>ðŸŒ›</sup> to connect their computer centers via antediluvian _wide-area networks_ and combat resources with all possible (for warming up) and impossible, and unthinkable hacks in _machine languages_.
