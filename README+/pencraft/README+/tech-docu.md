# Technical documentation

## Sources

Before writing from the ground up, I would search and try to adapt the following materials, if there exist:

### Similar writing

Any previous version, description of a similar product, any freeware pattern. It could even be a borrowed _magnum opus_, the owner of which may permit "plagiarism" just for reference and thanks.

### Requirements

Writing and maintaining requirements must concern project management, and you can use the result. Albeit there could be none in epistolary form.

### Tracking, versioning systems

A tracking system may collect and generate documentation with a pleasant degree of automation.

## Some guidelines to contribute

+ First and foremost, the less docu covers essentials the better for all (unless the subject deserves its own wiki). 
+ **Split the flow.** Long-running sentences, paragraphs, and sections are first-degree misdemeanors.
+ Except for citations use quotation marks for metaphors while _italic_ to introduce terms. Example:
> To compare _multitasking_ vs. _parallelism_ imagine the CPU being a "kitchen" where a quick cook vs. an orderly brigade can prepare the same courses.

+ **Last but not least**, if you write regularly, contribute to content management tools and templates to facilitate further work of you and others.
