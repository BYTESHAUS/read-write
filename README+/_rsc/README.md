# Resources&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artistic and other non-code 

The non-code stuff in repositories here contains diverse pictures, snapshots, schemes, quotes, wiki references, and other materials, both borrowed (from 3D parties) and owned.

## Own resources

Resources created under this personal profile, such as collages, memes, or texts, contributed by repository owner(s), can be reproduced without asking permission but explicitly referencing the GitHub profile.

## External resources

I have searched for and used works of others for fair and limited use:

* illustrative and entertaining purposes,
* just for fun,
* non-commercial.

When possible, I refer the source or/and attribute to the author.

## Miscellaneous

I couldn't trace the authors of certain images/texts. (Archaeologists say that the source of any can be found in cuneiform.) 
Some memes are too folk (public) or old to be proprietary or copyright-protected.

Some known images are utilized in collages for entertainment or presentation purposes only.

## Tools

The tools mostly utilized to stuff the repositories are:

+ **Paint.net**, dotPDN LLC®️,
+ **LibreOffice** (with its galleries),
+ **Grammarly** (writing checker),
+ Microsoft®️ **Office**,
+ Microsoft®️ **Visual Studio** (Community version),
+ and **GitHub**.
