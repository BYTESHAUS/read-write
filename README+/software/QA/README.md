# Software &mdash; Quality Assurance

Development's frivolous, fleeting, and improvising spirit makes software inherently error-prone. Breaking changes are as close as the fingers to the keyboard, you can always roll back and there's always a gap till delivery to production (for last-minute fixes or bug introduction).

Errors aren't only bugs but poor performance, and bad user experience.

Devs are by their lazy nature interested in hiding problems under the carpet. Quality control as a separate activity is inevitable.

## Natural born quality

Many must have witnessed projects done from scratch without allotted QA measures (and without test automation) but robust from the first release. 

This may occur in localized high-pro teams of responsible individuals writing [Quality code](README+/code-quality.md) but doesn't override quality proofing. On systems and big applications, teams will be distributed and uneven.

LITERATE separating and severity classification USTOICHIV SUDNA.

## Tests

First, let's put aside tests as ⚙️[drives](../design/drive) of development and design (though they may COMPLEMENT).

### Manual

The developer is the first tester.

### Automated tests

Bug searching and quality proofing tests are optional but highly recommended and a natural share of software development.
