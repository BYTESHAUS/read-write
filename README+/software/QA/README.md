# Software &mdash; Quality &mdash; Assurance

Development's frivolous, fleeting, and improvising spirit makes software inherently error-prone. Breaking changes are as close as the fingers to the keyboard, you can always roll back and there's always a gap till delivery to production (for last-minute fixes or bug introduction).

Errors are not only bugs but poor performance, frustrating user experience, and missing functionality.

## Natural born quality

Many must have witnessed big projects done from scratch without allotted QA measures and test automation (let alone code reviews) but robust from the first release. 
This may occur in localized high-pro teams of responsible individuals but such exceptions make the rule - separated QA is inevitable.

Writing [quality code](README+/code-quality.md) must be an objective but teams will be uneven, distributed/fluctuating, and stressed. Add the human nature to sweep problems under the carpet - quite big and thick in the software.

When security risks are a concern other approaches for hacking vulnerability come into play (and devs aren't writing code in a criminal-minded mode).

## Testing

> NOTE‚ùó**Write-first test coverage shall not drive design while design tests shall not cover functionality to develop.**\
<sub>This simple revelation struck me at a lecture on TDD when I realized that the last D is not for **D**esign but **D**evelopment.</sub>

> Let's put aside tests as ‚öôÔ∏è[drives](../design/drive) though they may complement to proofing coverage.

### Manual

The developer is the first tester.

### Automated tests

Bug searching and quality proofing tests are optional but highly recommended and a natural share of software development.
