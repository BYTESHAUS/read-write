# Software &mdash; Quality &mdash; Assurance

Development's frivolous, fleeting, and improvising spirit makes software inherently error-prone. 

The product is pure abstraction ether (or simulation), breaking changes are as close as the fingers to the keyboard, you can always roll back and there's always a gap till delivery to production (for last-minute fixes or bug introduction).

## What are errors 

Errors are not only bugs but poor performance, frustrating user experience, and missing functionality.

NOTE: WHAT IS Worth ERROR

## Natural born quality

There were and will be remarkable projects done from scratch without allotted proof and validatin measures (let alone code reviews and test automation) but robust from the first release. 

This may occur in localized high-pro teams of responsible individuals but only underlines the idea of separate software THEME &mdash; __QA__.

Writing [quality code](README+/code-quality.md) must be an objective but teams will be uneven, distributed/fluctuating, and stressed. Add the human nature to sweep problems under the carpet - quite big and thick in the software.

When security risks are a concern other approaches for hacking vulnerability come into play (and devs aren't writing code in a criminal-minded mode).

## Testing as QA

as QA because tests can have another use:  drives

### Manual (spontaneous)

Unlike to olden days with BLIND commits  PUNCHcards most development allow to evaluate its product (in whole or by feature) with every step: just build and run.

This makes the developer to the original, most PREPAred and, when responsible, most effective and critical tester.

### FORMALIZED TESTS and their automation 

COPY PASTE

Bug searching and quality proofing tests are optional but highly recommended and natural share of software creation. 

TEst automation is oft misnamed as AUTO, since may come hand in hand.
