# Software &mdash; Quality Assurance

Development's frivolous, fleeting, and improvising spirit makes software inherently error-prone. Breaking changes are as close as the fingers to the keyboard, you can always roll back and there's always a gap till delivery to production (for last-minute fixes or bug introduction).

QA is inevitable.

## Natural born quality

Many must have witnessed projects written from scratch without allotted QA measures (let alone test automation) but robust from the first release. 

This may occur in localized high-pro teams writing [Quality code](README+/code-quality.md) but doesn't override quality proofing. On systems and big applications, teams will be distributed and uneven.

## Tests

First, let's separate the writing of tests - ⚙️[drives](../design/drive)

### Manual

The developer is the first tester.

### Automated tests

Tests are optional but highly recommended and a natural share of software development. Be it driven design or anti-bug coverage.
