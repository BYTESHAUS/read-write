# Software &mdash; Quality Assurance

Software development's frivolous, fleeting, and improvising spirit is inherently error-prone. Breaking changes are as close as the fingers to the keyboard, you can always roll back and there's always a gap till delivery to production (for last-minute fixes or bug introduction).

QA is inevitable.

## Natural born quality

We must have witnessed projects written from scratch without allotted QA measures (let alone test automation) but robust from the first release. 

This can be achieved in localized high-pro teams writing [Quality code](README+/code-quality.md) but doesn't override quality proofing.

## Tests

### Manual

The developer is the first tester

### Automated tests

Tests are optional but highly recommended and a natural share of software development. Be it driven design or anti-bug coverage.
