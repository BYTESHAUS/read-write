# Software &mdash; Quality &mdash; Assurance

Development's frivolous, fleeting, and improvising spirit makes software inherently error-prone. Breaking changes are as close as the fingers to the keyboard, you can always roll back and there's always a gap till delivery to production (for last-minute fixes or bug introduction).

Errors aren't only bugs but poor performance, and frustrating user experience.

## Natural born quality

Many must have witnessed big projects done from scratch without allotted QA measures and test automation (let alone code reviews) but robust from the first release. 

This may occur in localized high-pro teams of responsible individuals but such exceptions make the rule - separated QA is inevitable.

Writing [Quality code](README+/code-quality.md) must be an objective but teams will be uneven, distributed/fluctuating, and stressed. Add here that NATURE to sweep problems under the carpet - quite thick in software.

## Testing

> Let's put aside tests as ‚öôÔ∏è[drives](../design/drive) of development and design (though they may complemet to proofing coverage).

### Manual

The developer is the first tester.

### Automated tests

Bug searching and quality proofing tests are optional but highly recommended and a natural share of software development.
