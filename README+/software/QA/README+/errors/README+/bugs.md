Let's assume the short word &thinsp;<mark><samp>&thinsp;<b>B&thinsp;U&thinsp;G</b>&thinsp;</samp></mark>&thinsp; as an umbrella term for any unintentional significant deviation of software from expected behaviour. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚪ This behavior may be exactly specified or implied.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; 🪲 Bugs must not definitely cause negative effects &thinsp; they can be all of a sudden useful and propose features.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; 🔬 Viruses and malware are **not** bugs. As well as missing features or bad UX.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; ➿ Not only code but hardware vulnerabilities may cause bugs. Remember [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability))<sup><b>w</b></sup>.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; 🔎 Bugs can be permanent and sporadic, easy reproducable and not.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; 🍴 Vulnerability to external errors and attacks is also a bug. (SQL injection, DDoS, user input of nonsense values, ...)

Let's assume the samely short word <mark><samp>&thinsp;<b>F&thinsp;I&thinsp;X</b>&thinsp;</samp></mark> for measures to handle the **found** bugs.
