# Software &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Errors

<p align="right">Â«<samp>There's no sound software.<br />There could be not enough QA.</samp>Â»</p>

**_Errare programata est._** Errors in software systems and applications aren't limited to [**bugs**](README+/bugs.md), tangible by users, but 

- poor performance (or great resource consumption),
- frustrating user experience,
- missing implementation,
- concealed elements and features,
- underused and misused parts,
- incompatibilities (versions, environment, and hardware),
- bad naming and text (particularly translations between tongues).

This wasn't the complete list. **The whole software product can be an error** (no sarcasm intended).
