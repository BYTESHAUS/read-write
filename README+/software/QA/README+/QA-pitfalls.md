# Quality Assurance &mdash; Pitfalls

It's not a strict study but observation and bookmarks.
 
## Conceptual

### Apathy

QA doesn't deliver and thus is the first item to be spared individually, by the customer, by a team, or by a department.

Perhaps this passes or with less luck may be nominated to the ten most disastrous bugs (at least of the department). 
Opportunistic quality issues co-exist unnoticeably for decades (as unfunctional 125% or 150% scaling in many mobile apps).

###  Formality vs. Informality

### "Wishful thinking"

The credit for a software product or team may be high and errors may vanish.

Automated and formal tests will give the green light to the classical parts and lull.

### "Blaming the messenger"

The mirrored twin of wishful thinking is the negative reaction of developers to reports.

The same as errors and bugs are seen as bad dev work.

which will discourage testers from reporting the error or soft-pedal them.

### Bad domain knowledge

"Blind" programming of the domain (analogy: tech translation done by linguist)

### Underestimate of foolproof, "criminal energy" and vandalism

System breaches can be shielded by "Who would ever...". Let's put a curtain on tales.

### Practical

### Sandbox

Usual conditions can be too good and stable  Select a bad loc. A must for network, async, and high load applications.

The easiest recipe is to develop/test applications in [unusual locations](../../../pencraft/README%2B/offtopic/anti-home-office.md).

 ### QA for TDD

This means careless development  [Test Driven Development](../../tests/asDrive)

This means careless development with QA in the loop as TDD LINK! and the hope they give fast feedback. This overloads the QA
