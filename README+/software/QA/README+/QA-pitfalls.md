# Quality Assurance &mdash; Pitfalls

QA can be a dedicated and responsibly taken organization, but the next traps ENDANGER.

## Conceptual 

### Underestimate

QA doesn't deliver and thus is the first item to spare on individually, teamly or corporate.

this may pass or not as with the poor Mars Climate Observer. LINK!

###  Formality vs. Informality

### QA for TDD

This means careless development  [Test Driven Development](../../tests/asDrive)

This means careless development with QA in the loop as TDD LINK! and the hope they give fast feedback. This overloads the QA

### "Wishful thinking"

The credit for a software product or team may be high and errors vanishing.

Automated and formal tests will give green light to  the classical parts and UBYukivat.

### "Blaming the messenger"

The mirrored twin of the wishful thinking is the negative reaction of developers. which will discourage testers to report the error or softpedal one.

## Practical

### Bad domain knowledge

"Blind" programming of the domain (compare to tech XLAT by linguist)

### Underestimate of "criminal energy" and vandalism

### Too good environment
