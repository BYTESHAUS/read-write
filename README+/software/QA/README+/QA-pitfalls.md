### NEGLIANCE

QA doesn't deliver and thus is the first item to spare on individually, by customer, teamly or corporate.

this may pass or not as with the poor Mars Climate Observer. LINK!

###  Formality vs. Informality

### "Wishful thinking"

Automated and formal tests will give green light to  the classical parts and UBYukivat.

### "Blaming the messenger"

The mirrored twin of the wishful thinking is the negative reaction of developers on reports.

The same as errors and bugs seen as bad dev work.

which will discourage testers to report the error or softpedal one.

### Bad domain knowledge

"Blind" programming of the domain (compare to tech XLAT by linguist)

### Underestimate of foolproof, "criminal energy" and vandalism
