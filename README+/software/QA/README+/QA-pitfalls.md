# Quality Assurance &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Pitfalls

There are some observation and bookmarks to share. Not for rant but as theses for organization.
 
## Conceptual

### Apathy

QA doesn't deliver and thus is the first item to spare on: declared or concealed, individually and by whole teams/departments.

Consequences are the subject of luck or misfortune. 

Non-critical features may be neglected for years &mdash; don't expect all popular (especially mobile) apps to support 125%, 150%, and 200% scaling. Localization of enough applications may be unreadable. 

###  Formality vs. Engagement 

ðŸš§ 

### "Wishful thinking"

A software product or a team can deserve a high credit, which sideeffect ls non-critical and shallow checks. Especially of the established parts.

Good personal relationships may (note **may**) turn on blind eye.

### "Blaming the messenger"

The mirrored twin of _wishful thinking_ is the negative reaction of developers to reports.

Who would treat discovered omissions and bugs as accusation of bad performance (mostly false).

And yes this means more job, stress and distraction.

This will discourage testers from reporting the facts or soft-pedal them.

### Bad domain knowledge

"Blind" programming and testing of the subjects is akin to technical translation by linguists.

### Underestimate of foolproof, "criminal energy" and vandalism

Stories of many system breaches and epic fails began with "Who would ever...". 

## Practical

 ### QA for TDD

This means careless development  [Test Driven Development](../../tests/asDrive)

This means careless development with QA in the loop as TDD LINK! and the hope they give fast feedback. This overloads the QA

### Sandbox and greenhouses

Usual conditions can be too good and stable  Select a bad loc. A must for network, async, and high load applications.

The easiest recipe is to develop/test applications in [unusual locations](../../../pencraft/README%2B/offtopic/anti-home-office.md).
