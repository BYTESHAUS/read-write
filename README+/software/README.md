## What makes it? 

**In a word - _development_, in four -**

These are **external** - optional and not, minor to strong, constructive and devastating (also neutral) - forces, factors, and drives. 

Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

Initiative and funding render the canvas. Abstraction/math/logic and artistic skills, domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

## Conclusion, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and time-unordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime will shrink them almost to rectangular, ...\

... making more theorizing redundant.

### ... which begins ...

However, axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** will tear this patchwork. It is not about megastructures (like OSs, IDEs, or gaming engines) and prize-winning brainteasers but challenges beyond the ordinary (say new LOB, CAD, or a great feature).

**X**: Coercive resource scaling against "horizontal" growth will deliver a kludge - horribly coupled, getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with little rational heritage (except how not to do it).

**Y**: Stacking design decisions (as they come) against towering abstractions will make up a modeling heap. Then the chaos (inherent to any software dev) will become unmanageable at a certain height. 

### ... _Arc Deco_

And here _Pure Reason_ may help to organize the job.

To distinguish our survey (at least for the file system) I couldn't find a better tag but a mocking acronym Arc&nbsp;Deco<sup>üé®</sup> (**Arc**itecture **D**esign d**E**velopment **Co**ding).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üé®</sup> <sub>Homonym to Arc&nbsp;Deco - [Arts d√©coratifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco). Its introduction a century ago (1925) calls to make `√§r(t)-dƒÅ-Ààk≈ç` great again [mockery again].</sub>
