# The creation of software

### **What makes software?** In a word - _development_, in four - 

[![Four colors of software: black->red->blue->gold](../pencraft/README+/_rsc/_img/darkCode2arcGold_wRem.jpg)](../pencraft/README+/_rsc/)

Add colors for project management, digital artists, DevOps, documentation, testing, and administration?

They are external forces that can be constructive and non- (also neutral). Culturally speaking: mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

## Arc DeCo

<p dir=rtl>,Arc - for <b>arc</b>hitecture<br/>,De - for <b>d</b>esign and d<b>e</b>v<br/>Co - for <b>co</b>ding</p>

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** combine tied, overlapping, and time-unordered processes. 
They may blend to almost a rectangular and imply little discussion and overhead for work.

... but the growth of a project will explode the picture in all dimensions ...

Architecture may describe both ARC and VISION ...

Arc and Dev are close to the keyboard while dev and coding are near to the keyboard.

## Behind the explosion sketch

## Impedance



IMPEDANCE, COMMU (look! also impedance here), ROLES (impedance!), GRAVITY vs LEVITY

## Roles

Thinks not persons but roles.

## Overlapping and communication

Let's see them intermixed

### Persons, roles, or tasks? 

## Subtasks of design

To keep the design thinking (not necessarily implemented in every step)

## Worth of `coding`

Coding is inevitable and everybody should practice it to the proper extent.

Let's first formulate what the coding is and what is different from dev.
Bugs lookup.

# Design - private derivations

## Duties and purposes

Besides the primary specification of software layers, modules, entities, functions, and their [naming](/README+/dev/README+/dev-naming.md/), concerns of design **are**:

+ detection of conceptual collisions<sup>:collision:</sup>,
+ [partitioning](/README+/dev/design/README+/software-parts/) (data, model, presentation, UI, biz logic),
+ use of [external](/README+/dev/design/README+/software-parts/ext_parts.md) libraries, frameworks, and services,
+ principal language-specific decisions,&nbsp;âœ‹
+ planned audience (roles, groups), 
+ visualization and presentation of modeling (like UML sketches)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:collision:</sup> <sub>Both unrealistic expectations (as an AI-chat that will fully replace hotline operator, or crack of math problem) and technical bottlenecks (as hi-definition images processing in pure C# or obsolete user platforms).</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>âœ‹</sup> <sub>I share my C# decisions in [use-dev](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev).</sub>

and are **not**: 

- user experience (unless UI or UX is the application subject),
- tongues (unless it's a linguistic app) and assistance,
- versions of languages and platforms,
- ways of authentication/authorization,
- details of implementation, like sort algorithms,
- code and docu management (as management system choice),
- maintenance of design artifacts (docu).

## Options of design

* maintenance of acquired or imaginative [design samples](README+/design_samples.md)

## Pitfalls

Besides trivial perfectionism, self-overestimate, and epic fails the next trivia often undermines the way of design:
