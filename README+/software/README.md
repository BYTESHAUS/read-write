## What makes it? 

**In a word - _development_, in four -**

These are **external** - optional and not, minor to strong, constructive and devastating (also neutral) - forces, factors, and drives. 

Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

Initiative and funding render the canvas. Math/logic and artistic skills, domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

## Conclusion, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and time-unordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime will shrink them almost to rectangular, ...\

... making more theorizing redundant.

 Axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** will tear this patchwork. It is not about megastructures (like OSs, IDEs, gaming engines) and IT prizewinners but challenges beyond the ordinary (LOB, CAD).

Pure resource scaling against "horizontal" growth will deliver a kludge - horribly coupled, getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with little rational heritage (except how not to do it).

Stacking design decisions (as they come) against towering abstractions will stack modeling heap and create chaos (inherent to any software dev) unmanageable at a certain height. 

To distinguish our survey (at least for the file system) I couldn't find a better tag but a mocking acronym Arc&nbsp;Deco<sup>üé®</sup> (**Arc**itecture **De**sign d**E**velopment **Co**ding).
