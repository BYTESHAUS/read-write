# The creation of software

### **What makes software?** In a word - _development_, in four - 

[![Four colors of software: black->red->blue->gold](../pencraft/README+/_rsc/_img/darkCode2arcGold.jpg)](../pencraft/README+/_rsc/)

* *The colors were inspired by an informal interpretation of the German flag (_Schwarz-Rot-Gold_): from the dark past through the bloody present to the golden future. 
Since $4>3$ tearful-blue was added for the _design_.

More colors for DevOps, administration, documentation, testing, and project management? The same for DIGITAL ARTISTS
With due respect, they are external forces that can be constructive and non- (also neutral). Artistically: mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

This layered picture won't qualify even for a [local imageboard](../../README+/pencraft/README+/opuses/IT-memes.md) but was intended as a platform for further discussion. Let's go.

## Big picture

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** combine tied, overlapping, and time-unordered processes. They may blend to almost a rectangular ...

... but the growth of a project will "blow up" the picture in all dimensions ...

You can easily imagine your own exploded view and here is mine ...

## Behind the explosion sketch

## Impedance

IMPEDANCE, COMMU (look! also impedance here), ROLES (impedance!), GRAVITY vs LEVITY

## Roles

Thinks not persons but roles.

## Overlapping and communication

Let's see them intermixed

### Persons, roles, or tasks? 

## Subtasks of design

To keep the design thinking (not necessarily implemented in every step)

## Worth of `coding`

The coding is inevitable nad shall be 

Let's first formulate what the coding is and what is different from dev.
Bugs lookup.

# Design - private derivations

## Duties and purposes

Besides the primary specification of software layers, modules, entities, functions, and their [naming](/README+/dev/README+/dev-naming.md/), concerns of design **are**:

+ detection of conceptual collisions<sup>:collision:</sup>,
+ [partitioning](/README+/dev/design/README+/software-parts/) (data, model, presentation, UI, biz logic),
+ use of [external](/README+/dev/design/README+/software-parts/ext_parts.md) libraries, frameworks, and services,
+ principal language-specific decisions,&nbsp;âœ‹
+ planned audience (roles, groups), 
+ visualization and presentation of modeling (like UML sketches)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:collision:</sup> <sub>Both unrealistic expectations (as an AI-chat that will fully replace hotline operator, or crack of math problem) and technical bottlenecks (as hi-definition images processing in pure C# or obsolete user platforms).</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>âœ‹</sup> <sub>I share my C# decisions in [use-dev](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev).</sub>

and are **not**: 

- user experience (unless UI or UX is the application subject),
- tongues (unless it's a linguistic app) and assistance,
- versions of languages and platforms,
- ways of authentication/authorization,
- details of implementation, like sort algorithms,
- code and docu management (as management system choice),
- maintenance of design artifacts (docu).

## Options of design

* maintenance of acquired or imaginative [design samples](README+/design_samples.md)

## Pitfalls

Besides trivial perfectionism, self-overestimate, and epic fails the next trivia often undermines the way of design:
