# The creation of software

### **What makes software?** In a word - _development_, in four -

These are **external** - optional and not, minor to strong, constructive and devastating (also neutral) - forces, factors, props, and drives. 

Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

Initiative and funding render the canvas. Math/logic and artistic skills, domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

## Conclusion, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and time-unordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime will shrink them almost to rectangular, ...

... making further "theory" redundant.

## ...  which opens tomes

Resource scaling on larger projects will tear this patchwork - not a figure of speech. Even if we speak not about megastructures (OSs, IDEs, gaming ecosystems, ...) but traditional LOB applications. 

Towering abstractions, FIELDS, and waves of task tides will result in badly manageable chaos. 
A less challenging design's growing size and complexity will last longer but deliver a kludge of loosely coupled parts, where "loosely" redefines horribly.

To delve in, we shall first explode the picture.'
