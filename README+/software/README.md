<sup>:de:</sup> <sub>Inspired by informal interpretation of the German flag: from the dark past through the bloody present to the golden future.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since `4>3` tearful blue was inserted for Design.)</sub>

**More spectrum for math, requirements, management, artistry, testing, and administration?**

These are **external** - optional and not, minor to strong, constructive and devastating (also neutral) - forces.\
Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

## Conclusion, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** combine tied, overlapping, and time-unordered role-driven processes. 

They may blend to almost rectangular and ask for little discussion and overhead for decent results.

Bigger project sizes will tear this patchwork.
