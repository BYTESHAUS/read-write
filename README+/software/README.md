# The creation of software

### **What makes software?** In a word - _development_, in four -

These are **external** - optional and not, minor to strong, constructive and devastating (also neutral) - forces, factors, props, and drives. 

Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

Initiative and funding render the canvas. Math/logic and artistic skills, domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

## Conclusion, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and time-unordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime will shrink them almost to rectangular, ...

... making further "theory" redundant.

Large/challenging projects will tear this patchwork - not a figure of speech. Even if we speak not about megastructures (OSs, IDEs, gaming worlds, ...) but traditional LOB<sup>üï¥Ô∏è</sup> applications or NAME4SMART. 

Horizontal resource scaling will result in a kludge - getting harder and more expensive to evolve, and maintain, with little EXPERTise for NEXT GENEs.

Towering abstractions, FIELDS, and waves of task tides will result in badly manageable chaos. 
A less challenging design's growing size and complexity will last longer but deliver a kludge of loosely coupled parts, where "loosely" redefines horribly.
