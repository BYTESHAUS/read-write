## What makes it? 

**In a word - _development_, in four -**

These are **external** - optional and not, minor to strong, constructive and devastating (also neutral) - forces, factors, and drives. 

Which, culturally speaking, mix, tint, blur, or shade (if not wash off) the four paints. 

Initiative and funding render the canvas. Math/logic and artistic skills, domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and time-unordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime will shrink them almost to rectangular, ...

 Axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** beyond the ordinary will tear this patchwork - not a figure of speech, not about megastructures like OSs, IDEs, gaming engines, and nominee solutions.

Resource scaling against "horizontal" growth (e.g. LOB) will raise a kludge - horribly coupled, getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with no rational heritage but how not to do it.

Stacking design decisions as they come to the model heap will make chaos (inherent to any software dev) unmanageable at a certain height.
