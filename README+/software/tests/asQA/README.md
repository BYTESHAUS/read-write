# Software &mdash; <samp>Quality Assurance</samp> &rarr; Programmatic Tests

  <h3><i>Programmatic test</i> is a fundamental QA stone.</h3>
  <p>Though unit tests are at the bottom of the pyramid any high-level test subject is a unit of its own.</p>
  <p>This works in the opposite direction: there's no atomic test unit that couldn't be dissolved into lesser (to cover rationally without the explosion of code size). 
  Our unit tests always drag lower lever units.</p>

## Test frameworks and languages

Writing tests in the language of their subjects is natural, practical, and facilitates [TDD](../asDrive), but

- UI has no programming language (like other amorphous themes).
- Some languages (SQL) or markup (HTML) aren't suited to describe tests or are too obsolete (mostly to be maintained).
- A domain may be written in a set of languages, or similar requirements implemented with different tools (e.g. JavaScript for front- and Java for backend).

Solution? Any popular language has some mainstream frameworks. Many frameworks also allow UI tests and modules written in any language.<sup>üèõÔ∏è</sup>\

## Automation

<blockquote><b>Programmatic ‚â† automated.</b><br />But tests are the intrinsic subject of automation when applicable and beneficial.</blockquote>

// ToBe written

## Down to the practice

The more pragmatic use-dev repo discusses and renders [tests stuff](https://github.com/Kyriosity/use-dev/tree/main/README+/tests).

## Poststriptum. Big problem and challenge

With all the benefits of the proof coverage and TDD<sup>eV</sup>, tests make up a second project requiring development and maintenance.
