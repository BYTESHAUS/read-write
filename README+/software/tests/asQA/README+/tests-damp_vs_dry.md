# Programmatic Tests &mdash; DAMP not DRY

<table><tr><td><p>Either <a href="../../asDrive">TDD</a> or proof of the provided code, <b>a conventional approach</b> is to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pick a software <b>entity</b> (class, function, or something else),</li>
        <li>consider a significant <b>use case</b> of it,</li>
        <li>and write a <b>test method</b> over this.</li>

Developing tests this way shall (<ins>not guaranteed</ins>) wrap features in pleasing _<b>D</b>escriptive <b>A</b>nd <b>M</b>eaninigful <b>P</b>hrases_ (_abbr._ <mark>&thinsp;<b>D&thinsp;A&thinsp;M&thinsp;P</b>&thinsp;</mark>).\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>Particularly with adorning tools like [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/10-minute-tutorial/?lang=java#write-a-scenario) that wrap tests into phrases, apprehensible not only by programmers but normal folks.</sub>

Needless to point out the virtues of this approach but one great flaw: <ins>&nbsp;<b>S&thinsp;I&thinsp;Z&thinsp;E</b>&nbsp;</ins> &mdash; fermented by a number of cases, rows of data, and their combinations, shared functionality, and repeating steps for alternative actions or different asserts.

<p>Developing tests this way will create a sound core, which with little documentation will describe the application and prove code essentials.</p>
<p>Adding more and more tests will slightly dissolve this core into a badly exorbitant maintainable bulk. With scrappy coverage, accumulated negligence, and impeded navigation.</p>

Another option is continuous refactoring with <mark>&thinsp;<b>D&thinsp;R&thinsp;Y</b>&thinsp;</mark> (<i><b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>repeat <b>Y</b>ourself</i>) first of all.

### Dimensional growth

* Miscellaneous sets of arguments (or test data) or even their order/combinations can make a difference.
* External settings may be an alternative.
* Different features and functions will not repeat themselves but have the same effects to test\
(especially error-proof)
* Possible vital <ins>test doubles</ins> of _Asserts_ and _Acts_ must show up in tests.
* Abuse of _Asserts_ and _Acts_ must be tested for handling misc. errors and exceptions.

Each of these items alone proportionally enhances 

#### Combinatorial explosion

This is the greatest hit.

#### Arrange &mdash; Multitype

Add here that argument combinations can matter and their MULTITYPE POLY (e.g. integer and floating point for the same calculation and even values).

## D<samp>RY</samp> it - A<samp>SSERT</samp>

If *Arrange* could be the **X** axis of extension then *Assert* must be **Y**. (It looks so on the screen.)

### Keep It Single. Or Multiple?

The widely adopted practice &mdash; one *Assert* per test method/test case &mdash; became the teaching and often a written rule.

Albeit the subject isn't always atomic as it may seem. An _Act_ may assume many actions and the test result can be split.\
For example, consider native methods as `string.IsNullOrWhitespace(..)` for either *Act* or *Assert*.

Repeating arrangements for miscellaneous _Asserts_ is a growth steroid. 
And there can be even a deeper negative side effect &mdash; a small error can trigger a salvo of failing tests. 
Such a salute will hardly provide a clue but rather hide it in dependencies - inevitable even with granulated and isolated units and best-structured folders.

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;History teaches us that one fail might be enough to know...s&nbsp;</ins></summary>

An anecdote tells that a DISTRESSED Napoleon why cannon were silent. The general was prompt to LIST seven reasons...

Napoleon interrupted him with: one is enough.

GRADUAL ASSERT



### Solutions

Gather and LIST in the order of dependence.

```csharp
// EXAMPLE PENDING
```

#### Master cautions

Advanced solutions shall deal with _Arrange_ and Act COMBO and branching but this requires a STUDY beyond a SKETCH.

## Wrap up. D<samp>RY</samp> but not drain 

DAMP or DRY? Neither but a compromise. 
ERODE BUT KEEP

Was it all about unit tests? Yes, but it can work for others in the pyramid. ELUSIVE and NO DISTINCT DIVISION

Does DRY applies to Test Driven Design? Yes, but limited with the BIAS that DAMP it's main motive.
