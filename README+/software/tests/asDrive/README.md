# Software Creation &mdash; Drives &mdash; Tests

<p dir="rtl"><b>,TDD is easy<br />.I started it over 100 times</b><br /><i>(.Mark Twain</i> would say)</p>

The hypothesis to write tests not only _a posteriori_ to validate available and running code but also prior - to guide development - can be rooted back to the 1950s.<sup>ðŸ‘´</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ‘´</sup> <sub>One of the best retrospectives is in [You won't believe how old TDD is](https://arialdomartini.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/you-wont-believe-how-old-tdd-is/)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup>.</sub>

**Tests make abstract matters tactile and feasible.** Simplicity and versatility make **TDD** superb for insight into fuzzy topics (almost any new application, novel development, or functionality).

Sorry to interrupt this idyll narrative but can't help speaking about the next branching:
