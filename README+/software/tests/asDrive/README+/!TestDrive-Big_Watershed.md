   <p align="center">Must this <mark><b>D</b></mark> be for <b><i>Design</i></b> or <b><i>Development</i></b>‚ùì</p>
<p>It wasn't about the destination of this ride, but the principal divergence. 
For the record, the title of the lecture resonated with my anxiety:  "Failed with TDD? Here you know why."</p>
<p align="center"> And yes, it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven <b>Development</b></a><sup><b>w</b></sup>.</p>

The de-abbreviation raised another doubt: where's _Design_? &mdash; I actively searched by <kbd>**T&thinsp;D&thinsp;D**</kbd> and fairly retrospected the found&nbsp;...

Presentations and lectures favored _development_ with _design_ as a natural<sup>üåµ</sup> spin-off, not much bothering about distinction and some exploited both terms interchangeably. 
Books and tutorials inclined more toward techniques, patterns, and testing frameworks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üôã</sup> <sub>Albeit being energetic in the recherche I couldn't go through the best part of treatises. There must be better findings, and there could be better alternating conclusions.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üåµ</sup> <sub>**Natural** since any complete snippet can't escape design or must fit into the given.</sub> 

Test-driven Development, fine for discourses, bootcamps, and `classes`, and encouraging to start features, didn't set forth for me to design just a mediocre project: hypothetical or tried.\
(The evolutionary design [wasn't the answer](../../../ArcDeco/README+/01.Rationale/README.md) either.)

### Test Driven Design

These tests and the code behind them must intensively utilize doubles (mocks, dummies, stubs) and ugly but fast implementation shortcuts (possible in most languages). When procs get fixed contours and stabilize - these doubles may GRANULATE tasks for development: test-driven or not.

### Test Driven Development

Use of the test double must be limited to indispensable (stubbing a remote service or unavailable data) and diagnose helpers (as spies).
