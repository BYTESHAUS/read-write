# Software &mdash; Test Drive - Pitfalls

### First and foremost

It occurs often that developers get lured into writing a piece of working code first and ... the whole further TDD is biased with broken enthusiasm for test drive.

### Underestimating

TDD/DDD may look first if not fun but a cozy exercise. Getting further will ask for tolerance to frustration. It will be much easier to jump off and leave the stuff "as is" (TDD work has tranquil acceptance on blurred criteria) than to admit misapprehensions, failed efforts, and rework again.

### Overfocus on structure and names

With only a handful of tests written accurate naming and categorization may distract one from new and convey little value. The detailed development and refactoring will urge you to revise these attributes. 

### Misjudgement of trivia

These mirages appear chiefly on the horizons of new software. Apparent "live" concepts look easygoing to implement without much TDD.<sup>:classical_building:</sup>
