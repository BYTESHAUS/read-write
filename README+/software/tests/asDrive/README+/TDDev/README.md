# Test Driven Development - not Design - Reminder

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ PLACEHOLDER ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

The purpose of TDD is in no way test automation but means to:

Optionally and cautionary:
+ start a **test framework** of the project (TDD will then outline test coverage with start stuff written in a good black-box manner).

### Downsides of TDD

it was so much test-driven flattery that some criticism must take place. The most negative influence could be _voodoo programming_ to achieve specific results.

Others are:

- ever-growing lines of non-production code, which require refactoring and maintenance lesser but comparable to main projects,
- lack (if not absence) of ripe active frameworks. // ðŸš§ ToDo: use-dev links to "3D tests"
