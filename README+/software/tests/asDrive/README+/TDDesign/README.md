  🚧🚧🚧 DRAFT in PROGRESS 🚧🚧🚧

Let's see tests as a superb conductor (or proxy) of [domain-driven design](../../../../design/drive#Domain-drive). TDD and **D**omain **D**riven **D**esign are perfect matches and will boost each other. 

With _design hat_ on one will draft domain objects, their functions, and relations, those that one wearing the _"test" hat_ will mock and stub, develop the syntax of their reference, and give essential feedback.

### Contraindications

T⚙️Design isn't _lapis philosophorum_ and is barely a good approach for:

+ code porting,
+ badly formalizable entities: artistic brush, or generated text (image, video, or sounds)
+ non-reproducible calculations.
