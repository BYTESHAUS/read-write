# Software &mdash; Programmatic tests

1950 it emblem

Programmatic tests, as we know them, appeared together with high-level languages. They are a unique part of software: optional but integral. They don't contribute to releases but have the same value as product's code. 

Tests are a no-brainer to start - they can be written in the same or other programming language as their subject and even without a framework. Just a call to a function/method/proc with none or some arguments and log/throw an error if the result doesn't match expectations.
