Getting started with testing is a no-brainer:

+ **It's simple** because it needs neither special skills nor following prescribed processes. (You can adhere to a methodology later.)
+ The start requires a **minimum** - knowing a programming language.
+ Popular and mostly free **frameworks** and auxiliaries unleash the writing and provide templates, test doubles, and device simulation.

Tests can be written in the same or other programming language as their subject, even without a framework. (A bare call to a function/method/proc with none or some arguments and log/throw an error if the result doesn't match expectations.)
