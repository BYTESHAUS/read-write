### Coded tests, as a discipline and an idea<sup>💡</sup>, appeared together with high-level languages.
  
+ They became a unique part of the software: optional but integral.
+ They don't contribute to product contents but are as essential as the foundation code.
+ They are versatile since they can be applied to any extent and direction and for differing purposes.
+ They can follow any practices and methodologies, even &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; no tests at all<sup>💫</sup>.

> **_Prog tests_ aren't the synonym of the <i>automated</i>❗ And vice versa.** (Albeit the overlap is big.)
> 
> Test-driven design doesn't require automation as well as debugging routines. Automated tests may imply hardware and even mechanical tools, or may schedule/guide manual user actions and collect reports. And so on.

### Getting started with testing is a no-brainer:

+ It's **simple** because neither special skills nor prescribed processes are obligatory.\
(You can adhere to a methodology later.)
+ The start requires **minimal** expertise &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;  basics of a programming language.
+ Popular and mostly free **frameworks** and auxiliaries unleash the writing and provide templates, test doubles, and device simulation.

Tests can be written in the same or another programming language than their subjects. Even without a framework. &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; 
Bare parametrized calls of core functions and properties followed by a log/error for unexpected results.
