# Software &mdash; Programmatic tests

Programmatic tests, as we know them, appeared together with high-level languages. They are a unique part of software: optional but integral. They don't contribute to releases but have the same value as production code. 

Tests are a no-brainer to start - they can be written in the same programming language as their subject and even without a framework. Just a call to a function/method/proc with none or some arguments and log/throw an error if the result doesn't match expectations.

Now, without discourse of technique trivia let's hit the first reasoning branch: [tests **for QA**](asQA) and [tests as **programming drives**](asDrive).
