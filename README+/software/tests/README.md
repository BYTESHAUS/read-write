# Software &mdash; Programmatic tests

1950 it emblem

Programmatic tests, as we know them, appeared together with high-level languages. They are a unique part of software: optional but integral. They don't contribute to releases but have the same value as the product's code. 

Tests are a no-brainer to start - they can be written in the same or other programming language as their subject and even without a framework. Just a call to a function/method/proc with none or some arguments and log/throw an error if the result doesn't match expectations.

ADD!!! copy about any extent etc

+ It's simple because it needs neither special skills nor prescribed processes.
+ It's versatile since it can be applied to any extent and direction, mock and stub anything, or rely on realistic data.
+ It's natural to start with writing a test method to test the first code snippets.
+ Popular and mostly free unit-test frameworks libraries equip one enough to start. (Any modern IDE is shipped with a selection of testing templates.)
