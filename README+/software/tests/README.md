Getting started with testing is a no-brainer:

+ **It's simple** because it needs neither special skills nor following prescribed processes. (You can adhere to a methodology later.)
+ The start requires a minimum - tests can be written in the same or other programming language as their subject, even without a framework.\
(A bare call to a function/method/proc with none or some arguments and log/throw an error if the result doesn't match expectations.)
+ Popular and mostly free test frameworks, libraries, and auxiliaries equip one enough to develop unrestricted:\
Templates, tests doubles for missing functionality, data mocks (like pseudo-production data), and end-device simulation.
