# Code, Dev, and Docu &mdash; Management &mdash; Overview

The exponential (and chaotic) growth of software projects in the 2000s founded the "parallel" realm of their organization: requirements/issue tracking, code collecting/versioning, collaboration tools, deployment services, and project management.

You must be reading now from a repository on _**Git**_&thinsp;<sup>:octocat:</sup> but names of other platforms, frameworks, and methodologies would take some screens to name only the popular ones.

## Good organization

The customers/users perspective - "not _how_ but _what_ matters" - draws a crucial dividing ridge: **either** organization serves development, **or** _vice versa_.

Commendable organization endows every process/measure with an exact explanation of how it facilitates development, spares resources, ensures quality, and automates routines. (Not because it's on trends or in chosen methodology.)

### Technical advantages expected

+ Intuitive environment with short learning curves and minor maintenance.
+ Limited branching and staging for justified "autonomy".<sup>üåµ</sup>
+ Barriers for commits of bad code (copy-pasted, violations of guidelines and styles, obsolete features, anti-patterns).
+ Eager use of code automation tools (including own frameworks).
+ Automated workflow of issues.<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üåµ</sup> <sub>E.g. branch - for optional/risky features bundle, test/staging system - for the dedicated team.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup> <sub>E.g. create tickets from `// ToDo:` or `NotImplementedException` and submit them to review when replaced with implementation code.</sub>

### Behavioral advantages wanted

+ _Processes_ do not suppress direct and casual communication (also with customers and users)
+ Meetings are condensed and limited to involved participants and provide tangible outcomes on code and docu
+ Iteration cycles plan feasible and ponderable results with relatively small organizational overhead
+ Coaching and mentoring focuses on domain and software (and much less on environment)
+ Commits/submits for integrity (not report only)

## Wrap up

DevOps grew from primitive file check-in/out to cloud solutions<sup>‚òÅÔ∏è</sup>, and now claims to use neural networks and <samp>LLM</samp>. However, as described in [my "Lotus" notes](../../pencraft/README+/essays/README+/LN-view.md) simple and sound tools still can do the job.

How? No methodology, organisation, and automation can beat _the laissez-faire_ of responsible craftsmen inclined to win-win.
