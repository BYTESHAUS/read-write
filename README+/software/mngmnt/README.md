# Code, Dev, and Docu &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Management&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Opinion</em>

The exponential (and chaotic) growth of software projects in the 2000s founded the "parallel" realm of their organization: requirements/issue tracking, code collecting/versioning, collaboration tools, deployment services, and project management.

You must be reading now from a  **Git**<sup>:octocat:</sup> repository while other platforms, frameworks, and methodologies will take some screen scrolls to name only the trending ones.

## Good organization

> **The customers/users perspective** &mdash; <mark>&thinsp;not **how** but **what** matters&thinsp;</mark> &mdash;\
> draws a crucial landmark: _**<ins>&thinsp;either&thinsp;</ins>**_ organization serves development,\
> _**<ins>&thinsp;or&thinsp;<ins>**_ _vice versa_.

A commendable organization endows every process/measure with an exact explanation of how it:

+ facilitates development,
+ spares human resources (especially in procedures and pushover tasks),
+ improves code quality and prevents errors,
+ automates routines.

And not because chosen methodologies and tools are massively promoted.

### Technical advantages expected

+ Intuitive environment with short learning curves and minor maintenance.
+ Limited branching and staging for justified "autonomy".<sup>üåµ</sup>
+ Barriers for commits of bad code (copy-pasted, violations of guidelines and styles, obsolete features, anti-patterns, experimental hooks).
+ Eager use of code automation tools (including own frameworks).
+ Automated workflow of issues.<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üåµ</sup> <sub>E.g. branch - for optional/risky features bundle, test/staging system - for the dedicated team.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup> <sub>E.g. create tickets from `// ToDo:` or `NotImplementedException` and submit them to review when replaced with implementation code.</sub>

### Behavioral advantages wanted

+ _Processes_ do not suppress direct and casual communication (also with customers and users).
+ Meetings are condensed and limited to involved participants and oriented toward tangible outcomes on code and documentation.
+ Iteration cycles plan feasible and ponderable results with relatively small organizational overhead.
+ Coaching and mentoring focus on domain and software (and much less on dev environment).
+ Commits/submits are for integrity (not to report/show the work mainly).

## Wrap up

DevOps grew from the primitive file check-in/out to cloud solutions<sup>‚òÅÔ∏è</sup> and now claims to use neural networks and <samp>LLM</samp>. 
However, as outspoken in my ["Lotus notes"](../../pencraft/README+/essays/README+/LN-view.md), simple and sound tools still can do the job.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>‚òÅÔ∏è</sup> <sub>like TFS became Azure DevOps Server</sub>

**How?** No methodology, organization, and automation can beat _the laissez-faire_ of responsible craftsmen inclined to win-win.
