# Code, Dev, and Docu &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Management &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; <em>Opinion</em>

The exponential (and chaotic) growth of software projects in the 2000s founded the "parallel" realm of their organization: requirements/issue tracking, code collecting/versioning, collaboration tools, deployment services, and project management.

You are likely reading from a **Git**<sup>:octocat:</sup> repository, while other platforms, frameworks, and methodologies may require some screen scrolling to name just the trending ones.

## Good organization

> **The customers/users perspective** &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; <mark>&thinsp;not **how** but **what** matters&thinsp;</mark> &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; 
> draws a crucial landmark:\
>  _**<ins>&thinsp;either&thinsp;</ins>**_ organization serves development (and tests), _**<ins>&thinsp;or&thinsp;<ins>**_ _vice versa_.

A commendable organization endows every process/measure with an exact explanation of how it:

+ facilitates development, `// minimazes installation, and maintenance`
+ spares human resources, `//especially in communication, procedures, and pushover tasks,
+ stimulates [quality&nbsp;code](../QA/README+/code-quality.md) and prevents errors,
+ automates routines when only justified.

And not because chosen methodologies and tools are massively promoted.

### Technical advantages expected

+ **Intuitive** environment with short learning curves and minor maintenance.
+ **Limited** branching and staging for justified "autonomy".<sup>üåµ</sup>
+ **Barriers** for commits of bad code (copy-pasted, violations of guidelines and styles, obsolete features, anti-patterns, experimental hooks).
+ **Eager** use of code automation tools (including own frameworks).
+ **Automated** workflow of issues.<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>üåµ</sup><sub> E.g., a branch for optional/risky features bundle, test/staging system &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; for the dedicated team.</sub>\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup><sub> E.g., create tickets from `// ToDo:` or `NotImplementedException` and submit them to review when replaced with implementation code.</sub>

### Behavioral advantages wanted

+ <mark>Processes</mark> do not suppress direct and casual communication (also with customers and users).
+ <mark>Meetings</mark> are condensed, involving concerned participants and oriented toward tangible outcomes on code and documentation.
+ <mark>Iteration</mark> cycles plan feasible and ponderable results with relatively small organizational overhead.
+ <mark>Coaching</mark> and mentoring focus on the domain and software (and much less on the dev environment).
+ <mark>Commits/submits</mark> are for integrity (not to report or show the work mainly).

## Conclusion

DevOps grew from primitive file check-in/out to cloud solutions<sup>‚òÅÔ∏è</sup> and now claims to use neural networks and <samp>LLM</samp>. 
However, as outspoken in my ["Lotus notes"](../../pencraft/README+/essays/README+/LN-view.md), simple and sound tools still can do the job.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>‚òÅÔ∏è</sup> <sub>like TFS became Azure DevOps Server</sub>

**How?** No methodology, organization, and automation can beat _the laissez-faire_ of responsible craftsmen with win-win attitude.
