## How to name...

### as usual

The prevalent naming is a derivative of the development, which

‚ùå rests on programmatic "false-domain" (as `Helper.Get(..)`, `Utils.Do(...)`, `Service.Find(...)`, and other no-brainers),\
‚ùå leaves "construction waste" of temporary names, placeholders,\
‚ùå spreads umbrella terms and horizontally swelling folders,\
‚ùå spawns long names and shallow categories (`AddTableReservation()`),\
‚ùå interferes with existing domain and functional naming,\
‚ùå contains jargon and slang.

### as crucial

The naming of libraries, packages (assemblies), folders, classes, methods/functions, and even non-public _vars_ must be a **‚Ññ1** challenge and involve the whole team<sup>:family:</sup> in discussions. 

The inevitable and noticeable expenses will pay off with the formation of ***lingua franca*** throughout the team and project, and ...
  
+ shared comprehension of a domain, collaboration, and indeed bound team,
+ genuine design and self-descriptive code,
+ inspiration for behavior/domain-driven design,
+ escape from heaps of docs<sup>üìí</sup>,
+ mitigated tension to get into a project for newcomers,
+ comfy navigation in the source code (beginning from <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:family:</sup><sub> The team means not only developers and managers but customers, testers with end users.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üìí</sup><sub> reqs/specs, DoU, meetings protocols, and primers - hard to follow but easy to misunderstand or forget but mostly neglected</sub>

You may see it as [domain-driven design](../drive/README.md#Domain-drive).

## Categorization

Categorization (classification) is much more profound than breaking collocations and sentences and building the folder hierarchy. &mdash; It makes the structural frame of sound abstractions.

// ToDescribe: Thinking in tags

## Wrapping up

Even top teams under time pressure and brakes on perfectionism would be barely proud of their implementation of naming. Furthermore, the naming (as [code quality](../../QA/README+/code-quality.md)) will never be perfect, but efforts to improve them must be continuous and genuine.

## Appendix. Posers

Some sitations with naming can be harder than difficult.
