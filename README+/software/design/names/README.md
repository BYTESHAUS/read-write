## Categorization

Categorization (classification) is much more profound than breaking collocations and sentences and building the folder hierarchy. &mdash; It makes the structural frame of sound abstractions.

## How to name...

### as usual

The prevalent naming is a derivative of the development, which

❌ rests on programmable "false-domain" with `Helper.Get(..)`, `Utils.Do(...)`, `Service.Find(...)`, and other supports,\
❌ leaves "construction waste" of temporary names, placeholders,\
❌ spreads umbrella terms and horizontally swelling folders,\
❌ spawns long names and shallow categories (`AddTableReservationInRestaurant(..)`),\
❌ interferes with existing domain and programming naming,\
❌ contains jargon and slang.

### as crucial

The naming of libraries, packages (assemblies), folders, classes, methods/functions, and even non-public _vars_ must be a **№1** challenge and involve the whole team<sup>:family:</sup> in discussions. 

The inevitable and heavy expenses will pay off with the formation of ***lingua franca*** throughout the team and project, and ...
  
+ shared comprehension of a domain, collaboration, and indeed bound team,
+ genuine design and self-descriptive code,
+ inspiration for behavior/domain-driven design,
+ help for creating and reading the documentation<sup>📒</sup>,
+ mitigated tension to get into a project for newcomers,
+ comfy navigation in the source code (beginning from <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:family:</sup><sub> The team means not only developers and managers but customers, testers with end users.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📒</sup><sub> reqs/specs, DoU, meetings protocols, and primers - hard to follow but easy to misunderstand or forget</sub>

And it as an ingredient of successful [domain-driven design](../drive/README.md#Domain-drive).

## Wrapping up

+ Even top teams under time pressure and brakes on perfectionism would be barely proud of their implementation of naming. 
+ The naming (as [code quality](../../QA/README+/code-quality.md)) will never be perfect, but efforts to improve them must be continuous and genuine.

🥇 Core S[E]QL commands.\
🏆 _Bread crumbling_ for navigation - both the idea and name selection win

Audience choice Price goes to Mrs. [Grace Hopper](../../../../pencraft/README+/quotes/README+/contributors/README.md#Grace-Hopper) who suggested tongue (English) semantics for programming (something so natural now that one can't evaluate).

🤦 And 1st place goes to ... `dirty` in miscellaneous languages and APIs as the trait of a modified object.

🍏 The prize for generalization goes to ... `interface` keyword.
