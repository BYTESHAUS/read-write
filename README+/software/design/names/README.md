## How to name...

### As usual

The prevalent naming is a derivative of the development, which

‚ùå leaves "construction waste"\
as `Helper.Get(..)`, `Utils.Do(...)`, `Service.Find(...)`, and other no-brainers.\
‚ùå spawns long names\
`AddTableReservation()`\
‚ùå jargon or working titles

### As must be

The naming of libraries, packages (assemblies), classes, methods, and even non-public _vars_ must be a **‚Ññ1** challenge and involve the whole team<sup>:family:</sup> in discussions. 

The inevitable and noticeable expenses will pay off with the formation of ***lingua franca*** throughout the team and project, and ...
  
+ shared comprehension of a domain, collaboration, and indeed bound team,
+ genuine design and self-descriptive code,
+ inspiration for behavior/domain-driven design,
+ escape from heaps of docs<sup>üìí</sup>,
+ mitigated tension to get into a project for newcomers,
+ comfy navigation in the source code (incl. <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:family:</sup><sub> The team means not only developers and managers but customers, testers with end users.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üìí</sup><sub> reqs/specs, DoU, meetings protocols, and primers - hard to follow but easy to misunderstand or forget but mostly neglected</sub>

## Categorization

Categoria
Naming couldn't be flat - it's an axiom, but categorization in software abstraction has two major challenges

* floating
*OOD.

## Wrapping up

Even top teams under time pressure and brakes on perfectionism would be barely proud of their implementation of naming. Furthermore, the naming (as [code quality](../../QA/README+/code-quality.md)) will never be perfect, but efforts to improve them must be continuous and genuine.
