# Naming &mdash; Guidelines &mdash;- Reminder

## Rules of thumb


* The higher the level of naming, the more attention.\
It's a routine to comb out
* Name, apply, get feedback, refactor.
* At least two people with different backgrounds must confirm the top names.
* _divide et empera_

* avoid names that may become language keywords (e.g. _field_ - hallo, C#13 preview)

## Traps

TRAP: Duplicate names in the chain!     PRINTER.PRINT

### Symbolic traps

ll -> EXAMPLES REQUIRED

INTERNATIONAL CHECK


## Verbal sins

- **Grandiloquence** 

General words sound vague (if not bombastic) unless established in the domain. Compare florid `[Fact]` to modest `[TestCase]`. 

- **Unexpected match** 

`public utility`

- **Jargonism**

### Guidelines for methods

`Get` must be taboo within method names - either this must be property or a better description of the returned: `Read`, `Calculate` u.a.

## Appendix 3 (of 3). Learning from others

### Hall of fame

+ Core S[E]QL commands.
+ _Bread crumbling_ for navigation - both the idea and name win

### Hall of shame

And 1st place goes to ... `dirty` used as the trait of a modified object.
