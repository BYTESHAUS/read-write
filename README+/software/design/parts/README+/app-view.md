# Application view &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Reminder

The _View_, as an interface to human sensors and actions in response, could not even be a sight but a voice assistant, or other means of communication.<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>ðŸ™‹</sup>&nbsp;<sub>Assuming how disabled people will use your application isn't only fair but can help with design posers down to business logic and architecture (keyword: abstraction).</sub>

## Acceptance

No error, null, or process behind shall break the presentation or freeze a view without a plausible feedback (e.g., perceptible start with animated splash screen).

A view that loads enough remote data must run decently even on a bad connection. Trivial? Alas, not for some mail services.

## Abstraction

_View_ must be an abstraction. Apply themes and skins but not colors, sounds, line styles, sizes, etc. However, there are exclusions besides the 1990s retro. For example, if your graph shows dozens of lines, you'll inevitably set their properties directly.

## Wrap up. _View_ is only a case

The intro above was a stereotypical limitation of the View to a user's vision. However, presentations can be APIs, data storage, or hardware interfaces (inputs/outputs).
