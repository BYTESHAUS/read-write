# Application view - Reminder

The _View_, as an interface to human sensors and actions in response, could be even not a sight but a voice assistant, or other means of communication.<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\

## Acceptance

No error, null, or process behind shall break the presentation or freeze a view without plausible feedback (e.g. perceptible start with animated splash screen).

A view, which loads enough remote data, must decently run even on a bad connection. Trivial? Alas, not for some mail services.

## Abstraction

_View_ must be an abstraction. Apply themes and skins but not colors, sounds, line styles, sizes etc. However, there're exclusions besides 1990s retro. For example, if your graph shows dozens of lines, you'll inevitably set direct their properties.
