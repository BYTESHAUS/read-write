## Drive and let drive

The solution is not being dogmatic.

Let's reserve 1:1 one-dir to BOOKs and look over agile.

### None and all

1:1

### Reverse to switch

ToDo: // ILLUSTRATION W/ BOOKs

###  Domain drive ... for all

_Domain-driven_ as dinstinct approach must assume that there're alternatives without. I doubt there're.

software as phenomenon, abstracts domains. explicitly or implicitly DD is permanent force.

We may describe only what violates it: naming exanples.

### ... reverse ?? driven domain

yes. 

SAP, ERP. E-Mail as an example

### Tests as separate tools

Testing was a pioneer methodology in driven dev and design.
