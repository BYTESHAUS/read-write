# Software - External parts

What are the cornerstones of a new big project - technologies, tools, requirements, planning, team, budget? Neither. \
**The fundamentals are already existing and proven concepts/components to adopt.**

Full-fledged third-party frameworks, libraries, and services allow developers to focus on application business and UX rather than tame technologies, type and maintain tons of boilerplate code; test, find, and fix extra bugs.

Such external parts are often a click away from evaluation and range:

* **from** solo algorithm **to** browser engine (hallo, Edge),
* **from** built-in source code **to** remote black-box service,
* **from** lib calls **to** injecting into frameworks,
* **from** open source and free **to** commercial and obfuscated,

Even great enterprises are reluctant to create the parts from the ground up and re-invent the wheel (unless it's rounder than others or "security first").

## Core components

Integration of video/image-processing/3D/browsing/search in custom applications is chiefly organic and indisputable.

## Frontend

Downright a must, met by more than experienced providers of suites, frameworks, and controls for Rapid Application Development: Telerik, DevExpress, Google, and Infragistics - to name a few.

Developers get the best out-of-the-box: state-of-the-art UI, professional look and feel, binding logical classes to place onto Model/ViewModel/Controller (with _table_ as the finest demonstrator).

## Backend

Simple to moderate applications need no elaborated structure - they begin with a few data context classes. For large projects teams shall weigh evaluation, learning curve, and fitting of the chosen framework against the hardship of own development.

Many frameworks are good at themselves but will burden your project with too much unclaimed "ballast" code.

## Testing

Components for testing are so organic for applications that are associated/integrated with popular languages/platforms/IDEs (Java, Angular) and DevOps. Their state for .NET got a piece of discussion in [C# nice-to-have](../../../../../.net/README+/a.review/cs-lacks-parts.md#testing).

## Free, commercial, open source, proprietary, initiative

Some non-commercial projects launched by individuals or groups have grown to industry standards and been adopted in mainstream languages. Remember [Newton.json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup> which has for years filled the JSON gap in C#.
 
Nevertheless, when applying such 3d-party think if there's a community (maybe, only you) - able to maintain the stuff within lifecycles of using projects. Recall accomplished but abandoned [Iron Python](https://ironpython.net/)<sup>ðŸ”—</sup> or prominent test mocks, last updated 10 years ago.

All-around pro solutions aren't free but annual dev licenses below $1K will quickly pay off even for a humble undertaking. Let alone live support and membership in a durable motivated community.&nbsp;<sup>:raising_hand:</sup>\
