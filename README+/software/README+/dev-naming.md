# Software - Naming 
<p dir="rtl"><i>"...In the beginning was the Word"</div></i></p><br/>
 

Naming is the most meaningful, underrated, and neglected activity in the realm of software. When smootly guides through the design and provides intuitive coding, it's seen as granted. When names are confusing, bulky, redundant, ambigous - comprehenstion problems and extra efforts are addressed to something else ("complexity of software", "learning curve", and "uniqueness").

## Process

The naming of libraries, packages (assemblies), classes, methods, and even non-public _vars_ must be a **â„–1** challenge and involve the whole team<sup>:family:</sup> in discussions. This expense will pay off with *lingua franca* throughout the team and project, and ...

+ common comprehension of a domain, collaboration, and indeed bound team,
+ genuine design and self-descriptive code,
+ inspiration for behavior/domain-driven design,
+ escape from heaps of reqs, specs, DoU, and meetings protocols - hard to follow but easy to misunderstand or forget (but mostly neglected),
+ reduced efforts to get into a project for newcomers,
+ comfy navigation within the source code (with an IDE's explorer or <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd>).

## CATEGORIZATION !!!

## Rules of thumb

The higher the level of naming, the more attention.

## Verbal sins

- **Grandiloquence** 



General words will sound vague if not bombastic unless established in the domain. Compare florid `[Fact]` to modest `[TestCase]`. 

PUBLIC UTILITY

- **Jargonism**

### Guidelines for methods

`Get` must be taboo within method names - either this must be property or a better description of the returned: `Read`, `Calculate` u.a.

# Wrapping up

Even top developers under time pressure and brakes on perfectionism will name logic classes as *services*, *helpers*, *utils*, *handlers* but would  be barely proud of that.

I mean that naming as [code quality](code-quality.md) can't be even perfect, but efforts to improve them must be genuine.

### Hall of shame

And 1st place goes to ... `dirty` used as the property of a modified object may hold the 1st place.
