# Code, docu and dev - Management systems

> NOTE: This article is about tools and methodologies but not activities of management (such as meetings, reporting, recruiting, and control).

The exponential (and chaotic) growth of software projects in the 2000s founded their organization's "parallel" ecosystem: requirements/issue tracking, code collecting/versioning, collaboration tools, deployment services, and project management. 

You are reading from my profile on _Git_ but names of other platforms, frameworks, and methodologies would take some screens to name popular only.

## Good organization

The customers/users perspective - "not _how_ but _what_ matters" - draws a crucial dividing ridge: **either** organization serves development, **or** _vice versa_.

Commendable organization endows every process/measure with an exact explanation of how it facilitates development, spares resources, ensures quality, and automates routines. (Not because it's on trends or in chosen methodology.)

### Technical advantages expected

+ Intuitive environment with short learning curves and minor maintenance.
+ Limited branching and staging for justified "autonomy".<sup>üåµ</sup>
+ Barriers for commits of bad code (copy-pasted, violations of guidelines and styles, obsolete features, anti-patterns).
+ Eager use of code automation tools (including own frameworks).
+ Automated workflow of issues.<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>üåµ</sup> <sub>E.g. branch - for optional/risky features bundle, test/staging system - for the dedicated team.</sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>‚öôÔ∏è</sup> <sub>E.g. create tickets from `// ToDo:` or `NotImplementedException` and submit them to review when replaced with implementation code.</sub>

### Behavioral advantages wanted

+ _Processes_ do not suppress direct and casual communication (also with customers and users)
+ Meetings are condensed and limited to involved participants and provide tangible outcomes on code and docu
+ Iteration cycles plan feasible and ponderable results with relatively small organizational overhead
+ Coaching and mentoring focuses on domain and software (and much less on environment)
+ Commits/submits for integrity (not report only)

## Wrap up

DevOps grew from primitive file check-in/out to cloud solutions<sup>‚òÅÔ∏è</sup>, and now claims to use AI. However, as I noted in [my Lotus Notes](../../pencraft/README+/opuses/LN-view.md) simple and sound tools can do the job lighter.

How? No automation can beat _the laissez-faire_ of responsible win-win-thinking craftsmen.
