# Rationale

Each sophisticated matter deserves its study: universe (cosmology), mathematics (philosophy), physics (epistemology), art (theory), building (architecture), excavations (anthropology) ...

Here we are to put shy abstractionsm brushstrokes of software canvas. Restricted reflection on the activity never harms and is intended for practical bonuses.

## Goal

Our ultimate goal is to achieve the consciousness of the software creation processes to avoid hacking and voodoo programming and treat the challenges right (as achievable and not). 
To avoid the building of kludges and sand castles.

## Postulates

+ We think about the software creation as a whole (not some particular applications no matter how complex or big they are).\
(shared inherited acquired experience) (And it's about our practical horizon -- not all software in the world)
+ We treat software creation as definitely the making of new\
(not porting)
* This isn't a methodology, technique, or teaching but trying to clear the obscure _materia_ behind the programming.
* This is a continuous learning where we add layer after layer.
* We will continuously staple our survey to practice, not to end up with classical "I know that I don't know" (Socrates).

## Objectives

+ classification
+ roles swap

## So ...
