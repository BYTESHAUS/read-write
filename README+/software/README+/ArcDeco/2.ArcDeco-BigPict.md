# Arc Deco - Big Picture

[![Arc Deco.](../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg)](../../README.md) ‚Äî [Rationale](1.ArcDeco-Rationale.md) -> **Big&nbsp;Picture** -> [Taxonomy](3.ArcDeco-Taxonomy.md) -> [Forces](4.ArcDeco-Forces.md) -> [Roles](5.ArcDeco-Roles.md) -> [Wrap&nbsp;up](7.ArcDeco-WrapUp.md)

The "tearing X and Y axes" in the [![Arc Deco.](../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg)](../../) intro was a 2D simplification for a figure of speech.

But let's limit ourselves to the usual 3D and have three vectors.

The next picture is label-free on purpose - you  may and shall ponder which forces and in which direction apply.
