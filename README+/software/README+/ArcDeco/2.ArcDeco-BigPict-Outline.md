# Arc Deco - Big Picture - Outline

The "tearing X and Y axes" in the [![Arc Deco.](../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg)](../../) intro was a 2D simplification for a figure of speech.

But let's limit ourselves to the usual 3D and have three vectors.

The next picture is label-free on purpose - you  may and shall ponder which forces and in which direction apply.
