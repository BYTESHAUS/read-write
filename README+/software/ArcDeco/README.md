# Software

## What makes it? 

### **In a word - `programming`, in four -**

Abstraction/math/logic and artistic skills, <br />domain expertise, and creativity prop the picture.

## Wrapping, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and loosely-ordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime, banality, and, also principal, isolated work on them will shrink the pie to a bar, ... ⬇️

Axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** may tear this patchwork:<sup>🙋</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**X**: Coercive resource scaling against "horizontal" growth will add to a horrific pile.\
(getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with little rational heritage except how not to do tips)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Y**: With stacking up design decisions (as they come) this pile will begin to fall to pieces at a certain height of abstraction.\
(That is, the chaos, inherent to any programming, will become unmanageable.) 

Such menaces encourage us to verbalize the metaphysics of software. 

To distinguish the survey following (at least for the file system) I couldn't find a better tag but a mocking acronym - <picture><img alt="Arc Deco" src="../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg" /></picture>&nbsp;(<mark><b>Arc</b></mark>itecture <mark><b>D</b></mark>esign D<mark><b>e</b></mark>velopment <mark><b>Co</b></mark>ding).<sup>🎨</sup>
