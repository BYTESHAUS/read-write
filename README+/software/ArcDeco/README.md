# Software

## What makes it? 

### **In a word - `programming`, in four -**

## Wrapping, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and loosely-ordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size lifetime with banality and, most importantly, isolated work on them will shrink the pie to a bar, ... ‚¨áÔ∏è\

Axes of e**X**pansion and complexit**Y** will tear this patchwork.

**X**: Coercive resource scaling against "horizontal" growth will add up to a horribly folded pile getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with little rational heritage (except how not to do it).

**Y**: With stacking design decisions (as they come) this pile will begin to fall to pieces at a certain height of abstraction. (The chaos, inherent to software, will become unmanageable.) 

<sup>üôã</sup> <sub>This said not about megastructures and prize-winning brainteasers (like OS, DBMS, IDE, or gaming engine) but challenges beyond the ordinary: new LOB, unfamiliar domains (such as CAD or interpreters), or cutting-edge modules (original graph network).</sub>

These threats give us legitimate space for the metaphysics of software. 

To distinguish the survey following (at least for the file system) I couldn't find a better tag but a mocking acronym -
