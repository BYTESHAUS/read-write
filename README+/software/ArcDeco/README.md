### is abstraction but ...

## What implements it? 

### In a word &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; `programming`, in four &thinsp;&mdash;

## Wrapping, ...

**_Coding_**, **_development_**, **_design_**, and **_architecture_** are tied, overlapping, and loosely-ordered role-driven processes.

Many projects' modest size and lifetime, banality, and isolated work on them will shrink the pie to a bar... ‚¨áÔ∏è

#### Axes of e<mark>X</mark>pansion and complexit<mark>Y</mark> may tear this patchwork:<sup>üôã</sup>

&harr; **<mark>X</mark>**: Coercive resource scaling against "horizontal" growth will add to a horrific pile.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; (getting harder and more expensive to evolve and maintain, with little rational heritage except "how not to do" tips)

&varr; &nbsp;**<mark>Y</mark>**: With stacking up design decisions (as they come), this pile will begin to fall to pieces at a certain height of abstraction.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; (That is, the chaos, inherent to any programming, will become unmanageable.) 

Such menaces encourage us to verbalize the metaphysics of software.

Even great masters didn't paint _magnum opus_ from the first cast but began with the primer. 
Let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush, and with shy strokes put a layer after layer on the canvas of ...\
