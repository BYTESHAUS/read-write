# The Big Picture

Explanation of compound stuff needs a big outline, otherwise, it will be esoteric and duller than planned. 
It may come out commonplace, a plane section, angled or blurred but it will beat hundreds of words and ensure you with vision.

## Forces 

First, let's take proposed [![Arc Deco.](../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg)](../../README.md) **stripes** and draw forces over them. 

The <mark>"tearing X and Y axes"</mark> in the intro were a two-dimension simplification for a figure of speech. The next outlines (intentionally not annotated) must defy your 3D imagination.

Now let me present my vision of these forces, while you may already got your own ideas.
