# The Big Picture

Explanation of compound stuff needs a big portrait, otherwise, it will be esoteric and duller than planned. 
It may come out commonplace, a plane section, angled or blurred, or even childish but it will beat explanation prose and ensure you with an eagle view.

Let's begin with contours, intentionally left not annotated to defy the reader's 3D imagination. It would be nice if she or he could guess or imagine the forces and factors (they ought not to match those, as explained below).

## Forces and factors

The <mark>"tearing X and Y axes"</mark> in the intro were a two-dimension simplification for a figure of speech.

## Background

To avoid image overloading, I haven't included the background - the sheets of resulting code with data and documentation. Just imagine them behind the picture.

## What's next

This work of art may look juvenile but let's dive deeper into details in the following chapters.
