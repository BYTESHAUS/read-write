# Rationale

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A metaphor you may skip&nbsp;</ins>&nbsp;...</summary>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... but (thanks) you've clicked.

<p dir="rtl">A cherry-picked <b>metaphor</b><br />.simplifies explanation<br />(.At times even for readers)</p>

<table><tr valign="top"><td><p><b>Figure of chess is a universal figure of speech...</b><sup>♟️</sup></p>
  <p><img alt="&nbsp;IT chess phantasy" src="../../../../_rsc/_img/illus/ChessIT.jpg" /></p>
<div dir="rtl"><sub>or I'm boring and unimaginative to&nbsp;&#8230;&nbsp;</sub><sup>♟️</sup><br><sub>.propose better and smarter analogies</sub></div>
  <br /><br /></bre><blockquote><b>Who is the opponent in software?</b><br />
  Not a customer, a manager, or a user.<br />The development!</blockquote>
</td><td>
<p>♕♛&nbsp;Learning elementary programming and the rules of the checkered strategy are both fast and attainable for the masses. 
Starting programming resembles games of neophytes: <i>blitz</i> (wins follow fails), fun, and visibly improving.</p>

<p>♖♜&nbsp;Understanding and learning principles and check patterns will prevent blunders but not positional traps of better opponents.<br />
In like manner, a keen junior will soon write good pieces of code but shaky solutions.</p>

<p>♗♝&nbsp;Chess openings rest on studied memorized decisions and strong theory. In software, it means IT education, selection of platforms, frameworks, and external parts, when experimentation and creativity are abnormal</p>

<p>♘♞&nbsp;Then the perception of combinatory vastness and the need to think in several moves lifts the curtain of first naive impressions.<br />
"Moves" in software are multilevel projections over digits and their calculations with enormous space <code><b>&gt;</b>&thinsp;8x8</code> for phantasies and alternative solutions.</p>

<p>To rise to a higher rank requires a "binocular" of passion and a "torch" of theory. The number of games or written applications won't break the ceiling.<sup>👑</sup></p>
  
<p>In chess theoretical roadmaps and schools lead to higher ratings, which ruthlessly show one's place. <ins>Here the metaphor breaks down.</ins> 
Software ways to craftsmanship are inscrutable and assessed by eye.</p>
<div dir="rtl"><sub>&mdash;&nbsp;Major chess servers can brag about legends&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; not bots, pausing for sleep only</sub><sup>👑</sup><br /><sub>.with an enormous number of games but amateur slightly growing ELO ratings</sub></div>

<p align="center"><b><samp>Why doesn't advanced development make the great design by itself?</samp>&thinsp;<sup>🙋</sup></b></p>

Veneer with <ins>rhetorical</ins> vs. <ins>open</ins> <kbd>&thinsp;<samp><b>I&thinsp;S</b></samp>&thinsp;</kbd>, <kbd>&thinsp;<samp><b>W&thinsp;H&thinsp;Y</b></samp>&thinsp;</kbd>, and <kbd>&thinsp;<samp><b>H&thinsp;O&thinsp;W</b></samp>&thinsp;</kbd> tiles:

* Is there something supernatural in system design compared to project development?
* Why is experience rather an inhibitor of rapid development?
* How can the code obfuscate lucid domain logic for reviewers?
* Why don't bright architecture ideas propagate to development?
* Why is getting into big projects a headache and dread?
* Why adapting external solutions may require excessive work?
* Why don't many good design decisions survive and how do bad ones rematerialize in the next endeavors?
* Why are developers doomed to repeat decisions and solutions done by others?
* Why do frankly bad parts of dark code nonetheless fuse to enterprise architecture that works and persists for years?
* Why could a harmless syntax sugar be delayed for releases as a _breaking change_? 
* How smart leads go between evolutionary kludges and "conceptualism" utopia.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Developing excellent features, feeling the patterns and principles, and writing [quality code](../../../QA/README+/code-quality.md) but designing euphoria over it succumbs to achieving a passable project state.</sub>

The external heartening or intimidating factor is the construction of more material, safer and less patchable and shapeable megastructures: liquefied gas tankers, skyscrapers, airplane auto-navigation).

## Goal

Bridge development to design.
This requires **abstraction of** software **abstractionism** but with utilitarian intentions: detecting what helps and harms in mundane code (that is, answers the <samp><i>WHY</i></samp>s and <samp><i>HOW</i></samp>s above).

### Objectives

* Keep software as a whole continuous "application" of pieces of IT theory and practical decisions, rather than tailored scattered occasional craft, or the building of sand castles on greenfields, or the _Grand Art_ of perfectionism.
* Classify parts, activities, and roles.
* Think over "rails" and the burden of previous experience.
* Eliminate the fear of "high" design decisions.

We can't paint <picture><img alt="&thinsp;Arc&nbsp;Deco" src="../../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg" /></picture> from the first cast but let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush<sup>🔦</sup>, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of software abstractionism...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🔦</sup> <sub>Hmm, I talked about the torch and binoculars in the chess metaphor.</sub>
