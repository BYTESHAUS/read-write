# Rationale

<details><summary><ins>&nbsp;A chess metaphor you may skip&nbsp;</ins>&nbsp;...</summary>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... but you clicked.

<p dir="rtl">A cherry-picked <b>metaphor</b><br />.simplifies explanation<br />(.At times even for readers)</p>
<b>Chess is a universal metaphor...</b><sup>♟️</sup>
<table><tr><td><img alt="&nbsp;IT chess phantasy" src="../../../../_rsc/_img/illus/ChessIT.jpg" /></td><td>
<p>♕♛ Learning the basics of programming is as easy as the rules of the checkered strategy. 
Getting into programming resembles games of neophytes: <i>blitz</i> (wins follow fails), fun, and considerably advancing.</p>

<p>♖♜ Understanding and learning principles and check patterns will prevent blunders but not positional traps of better opponents.<br />
In like manner, a keen junior will soon write good pieces of code but shaky solutions.</p>

<p>♘♞ Then the perception of combinatory vastness and the need to think in several moves lifts the curtain of first naive impressions.<br />
"Moves" in software are multilevel projections over digits and their calculations with enormous space <code>>8x8`</code> for phantasies and alternative solutions.</p>

To rise to a higher rank requires a "binocular" of passion and a "torch" of theory. Here the metaphor breaks down. There are clear theoretical roadmaps and schools in chess and the rating will ruthlessly show one's place. 
The software doesn't know chess restraints with teaching, and assessment by eye.

Technical &thinsp;<samp><b>E&thinsp;N&thinsp;L&thinsp;I&thinsp;G&thinsp;H&thinsp;T&thinsp;E&thinsp;N&thinsp;M&thinsp;E&thinsp;N&thinsp;T</b></samp>&thinsp; has many facets with two secured: <b>enthusiasm</b> and <b>frustration</b>. These are paved with miscellaneous dilemmas but one pivotal, which in software interpretation is:

<p align="center"><b>Why doesn't advanced development make great design by itself?<sup>🙋</sup></b></p>

A few of other <ins>rhetorical</ins> vs. <ins>open</ins> &thinsp;<mark><samp><b>W&thinsp;H&thinsp;Y</b></samp></mark>&thinsp; **tiles** are:

* Why would the code of the well-known domain obfuscate the reviewer?
* Why is getting into most solutions a headache and dread?
* Why don't many good design decisions survive and those bad ones do rematerialize in the next projects?
* Why are developers doomed to repeat decisions and solutions done by others?
* Why do frankly bad parts nevertheless fuse to enterprise architecture which works and persists for years?
* Why evolutionary design makes kludges, while "conceptualism" ends in utopia.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Developing excellent features, feeling the patterns and principles, but designing euphoria over it succumbs to achieving a passable project state.</sub>
 
## Objectives

Above all: **abstraction of** software **abstractionism** but with utilitarian intentions: detecting what helps and harms in mundane code.

* Software as a whole continuous "application" of pieces of IT theory and practical decisions, rather than tailored scattered occasional craft, or the building of sand castles on greenfields, or the "Grand Art" of perfectionism.
* Classify parts, activities, and roles.
* Think over "rails" and the burden of previous experience.
* Eliminate the fear of "high" design decisions.

## Wrap up

We can't paint <picture><img alt="&thinsp;Arc&nbsp;Deco" src="../../../../_rsc/_img/ArcDeco/ArcDeco-bar-12px.jpg" /></picture> from the first cast but let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush<sup>🔦</sup>, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of software abstractionism...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🔦</sup> <sub>Hmmm, I talked about the torch and binoculars in the chess metaphor.</sub>
