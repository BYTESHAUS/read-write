<p dir="rtl">A cherry-picked <b>metaphor</b><br />.simplifies explanation<br />(.At times even for readers)</p>

**Chess is a universal metaphor.** Learning the basics of programming is as easy as the rules of this strategy, and beginning programming resembles the first games: _blitz_, enjoyable, and considerably advancing.

The qualitative progress will abruptly slow down in excellence at a certain complexity level. In chess, there are blunders or positional traps of even a slightly better opponent. 
In software, writing cool features won't make up a great design. 

Then you realize the enormous complexity behind the curtain of naive impressions, and that you won't progress without theorizing yourself.

Here the metaphor breaks down. They'ы a clear roadmap in chess and the rating will ruthlessly show one's place. In the software, one can be an architect of kludges.
