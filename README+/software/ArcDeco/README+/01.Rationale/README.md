Win - Breaking changes go light.

Checked - principal changes are done with Woodoo programming.

Stalemate - the project works, but big features can hardly be added.

Mate - dev stops, support only. It is time to give it away to another team and speak about a remake in other technologies.

♕♛ Learning elementary programming and the rules of the checkered strategy are both fast, enjoyable, and attainable for the masses. 
Starting programming resembles games of neophytes: <i>blitz</i> (wins follow fails), fun, and visibly improving.

♖♜ Understanding and learning principles and check patterns will prevent blunders, but not positional traps of better opponents.\
In like manner, a keen junior will soon write good pieces of code but shaky solutions.

♗♝ Chess openings rest on studied, memorized decisions and strong theory. In software, it implies IT literacy, computer science, selection of platforms, frameworks, 
and external parts, when experimentation and creativity are abnormal.

♘♞ Then the perception of combinatory vastness and the need to think in several moves lifts the curtain of first naive impressions.\
There are only three "moves" in programming: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` over bits, but they provide even the bigger than <code><b>&gt;</b>&thinsp;8x8</code> space for fantasies and alternative solutions.

<p>Passion wouldn't be enough to rise much higher &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; learning and understanding of theory become essential along with games against stronger opponents. &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;
The number of games or written applications won't break the ceiling.<sup>👑</sup></p>
  
In chess, theoretical roadmaps and schools lead to higher ratings, ruthlessly administering one's place. <b>Here, the metaphor breaks down.</b> 
Software ways to craftsmanship are inscrutable and assessed by eye.

**More (de)motivation:**
  
Successful projects from the neighboring materiality, less patchable and less reversible but much more fragile, may both hearten or intimidate:\
Liquefied gas tankers, skyscrapers, airplane auto-navigation, implants, space telescopes, robotic lines ...

And these are your peers with different backgrounds who created them. «Not gods fired these pots.»

## Goal

Bridge development to design. This requires **abstraction of** software **abstractionism** but with utilitarian intentions: 
detecting what helps and what harms in mundane code (that is, answers the <samp><i>WHY</i></samp>s and <samp><i>HOW</i></samp>s above).

### Objectives

* Keep software as a whole continuous "application" of pieces of IT theory and practical decisions, rather than tailored scattered occasional craft, or the building of sand castles on greenfields, or the _Grand Art_ of perfectionism.
* Classify parts, activities, and roles.
* Think over "rails" and the burden of previous experience.
* Eliminate the fear of "high" design decisions.

## What's next

Even great masters didn't paint _magnum opus_ from the first cast but began with the primer. Let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of ...\
