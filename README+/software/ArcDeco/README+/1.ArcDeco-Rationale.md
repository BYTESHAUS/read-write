# Rationale

Each sophisticated matter deserves its study: universe (cosmology), mathematics (philosophy), physics (epistemology), art (theory), building (architecture), excavations (anthropology) ...

Restricted reflection on the subject of activity (as calculations and software) never harms especially when intended for practical rewards.

## Goal

Our ultimate goal is to develop the consciousness to **help**<sup>🙋</sup> browse software as a whole, the challenges right (as achievable and not) and prevent voodoo programming and building sand castles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Note the word help - Arc Deco is neither teaching, nor methodology, nor ideology.</sub>

## Postulates

+ We think about the software creation as a whole (not some particular applications no matter how complex or big they are).\
(shared inherited acquired experience) (And it's about our practical horizon -- not all software in the world)
+ We treat software creation as definitely the making of new\
(not porting)
* This isn't a methodology, technique, or teaching but trying to clear the obscure _materia_ behind the programming.
* This is a continuous learning where we add layer after layer.
* We will continuously staple our survey to practice, not to end up with classical "I know that I don't know" (Socrates).

## Objectives

+ classification
+ roles map and swap

So, let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of software abstractionism:

+ reflection,
+ comprehension,
+ explanation,
+ practical conclusions,
+ application!
