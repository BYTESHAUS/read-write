# Rationale

Each sophisticated matter deserves its study: universe (cosmology), mathematics (philosophy), physics (epistemology), art (theory), building (architecture), excavations (anthropology) ... 

Even if the subject of the activity (as software) is mundane, the restricted reflection never harms especially when intended for practical rewards.

Software is descriptive and agile formalization and coding of variegated extrinsic concepts but far more abstractive than similar electronics, mechanical engineering, or building.

Being a multilevel imagination, fastly implemented over digits and their calculations, the software renders enormous space for utilitarian phantasies and alternativeness of solutions.

## Goal

Purely practical. A **help**<sup>🙋</sup> to perceive software as a whole continuous "application" of IT pieces of knowledge, rather than tailored scattered occasional craft, or the building of sand castles on greenfields, or the "great art" of perfectionism.

The outcome shall be a better vision and strategy (planning) with less inevitable hacking and voodoo programming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Note the word 'help' - Notes of Arc Deco are neither teaching, nor methodology, nor ideology. At least now.</sub>

## Postulates

+ We think about the software creation as a whole (not some particular applications no matter how complex or big they are).\
(shared inherited acquired experience) (And it's about our practical horizon -- not all software in the world)
+ We treat software creation as definitely the making of new\
(not porting)
* This isn't a methodology, technique, or teaching but trying to clear the obscure _materia_ behind the programming.
* This is a continuous learning where we add layer after layer.
* We will continuously staple our survey to practice, not to end up with classical "I know that I don't know" (Socrates).

## Objectives

+ classification
+ roles map and swap

---

So, let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of software abstractionism:

+ reflection,
+ comprehension,
+ explanation,
+ practical conclusions,
+ application!
