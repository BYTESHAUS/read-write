# Rationale

Each sophisticated matter deserves its study: universe (cosmology), mathematics (philosophy), physics (epistemology), art (theory), building (architecture), excavations (anthropology) ... 

Even if the subject of the activity (as software) isn't grandiose, restricted reflection never harms especially when intended for practical rewards.

Software is neither science nor art but far more abstractive than electronics, mechanical engineering or building. It's descriptive and prompt formalization and coding of variegated extrinsic concepts. 

Being a fast-done multilevel imagination over digits and their calculations (hardware) software opens enorm space for the utilitarian phantasies and alternative solutions.

## Goal

It's a **help**<sup>🙋</sup> to perceive software as a whole continuous "application" of IT knowledge. Rather than tailored scattered occasional craft, or the building of sand castles on greenfields, or the "great art" of perfectionism.

The outcome shall be the better vision and strategy (planning).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Note the word 'help' - Notes of Arc Deco are neither teaching, nor methodology, nor ideology. At least now.</sub>

## Postulates

+ We think about the software creation as a whole (not some particular applications no matter how complex or big they are).\
(shared inherited acquired experience) (And it's about our practical horizon -- not all software in the world)
+ We treat software creation as definitely the making of new\
(not porting)
* This isn't a methodology, technique, or teaching but trying to clear the obscure _materia_ behind the programming.
* This is a continuous learning where we add layer after layer.
* We will continuously staple our survey to practice, not to end up with classical "I know that I don't know" (Socrates).

## Objectives

+ classification
+ roles map and swap

---

So, let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of software abstractionism:

+ reflection,
+ comprehension,
+ explanation,
+ practical conclusions,
+ application!
