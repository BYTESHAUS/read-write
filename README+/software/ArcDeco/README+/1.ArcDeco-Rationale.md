# Rationale

Each sophisticated matter deserves its study: universe (cosmology), mathematics (philosophy), physics (epistemology), art (theory), building (architecture), excavations (anthropology) ... 

Even if the subject of the activity (as software which isn't a science) is less academic, restricted reflection never harms especially when intended for practical rewards.

Software is highly functional and descriptive, that is it doesn't need too much theory and isn't a STRICT science. At the same time, it's MUCH MORE abstract than mechanical engineering or building. THAT IS PHANtASY. ALTERNATIVEs

## Goal

It's a **help**<sup>🙋</sup> to perceive software as a whole continuous "application" of computer science. Rather than tailored scattered occasional craft with intrinsic hacking and voodoo programming, or the building of sand castles on greenfields, or the great art of perfectionism.

And thus have better vision and strategy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🙋</sup> <sub>Note the word 'help' - Arc Deco is neither teaching, nor methodology, nor ideology. At least now.</sub>

## Postulates

+ We think about the software creation as a whole (not some particular applications no matter how complex or big they are).\
(shared inherited acquired experience) (And it's about our practical horizon -- not all software in the world)
+ We treat software creation as definitely the making of new\
(not porting)
* This isn't a methodology, technique, or teaching but trying to clear the obscure _materia_ behind the programming.
* This is a continuous learning where we add layer after layer.
* We will continuously staple our survey to practice, not to end up with classical "I know that I don't know" (Socrates).

## Objectives

+ classification
+ roles map and swap

---

So, let's roll up our sleeves, take a brush, and with shy strokes put layer after layer on the canvas of software abstractionism:

+ reflection,
+ comprehension,
+ explanation,
+ practical conclusions,
+ application!
