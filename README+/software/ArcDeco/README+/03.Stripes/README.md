🚧🚧🚧 ... DRAFT in progress ... 🚧🚧🚧

Remember that our patchwork demonstratively overlaps motley **stripes**<sup>📚</sup> with gradient transition? This means ...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📚</sup> <sub>Synonymic ***tiers*** and **layers**** are already strongly associated with practical architecture/design.</sub>

In general Let's divide first into two tiers: coding vs. development (closer to the keyboard) and Design Architecture (closer to the whiteboard)

Development vs. Coding

Architecture vs. Design

Architecture, opposite to design, must be a platform-independent<sup>🎈</sup> abstraction which nevertheless must grow from the practical development.

Architecture may describe both ARC and VISION ...


Wrap up.

What is good design-development? Balancing on edge between TYPE-MACHINE to stuck in thoughts
When you find finished good but IMMEDIATELY have an idea how to redo.

## Worth of coding

coding is oft regarded as menial practice...

Everything done on the keyboard to code is the coding. The pure coding is inefficient -< Roles
